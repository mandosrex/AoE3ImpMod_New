		<String _locID="34703" soundfilename="AMEL4010">The rest... well, like most family stories, it's hard to separate the truth from the legend.</String>
		<String _locID="34704" soundfilename="AMEL4100">With Alain Magnan dead and the Fountain destroyed, the Circle of Ossus had nothing left in the New World.</String>
		<String _locID="34705" soundfilename="AMEL4105">Sahin knew the Europeans were carving out empires in the Americas. He realized that the Ottomans were as much relics of the past as the Knights of St. John.</String>
		<String _locID="34707" soundfilename="AMEL4115">Lizzie had lost her Spanish gold, and it would be several years before she really forgave Morgan.</String>
		<String _locID="34708" soundfilename="AMEL4120">I'm not sure if she was really my great-great-grandmother, but folks say I have a pirate's temper.</String>
		<String _locID="34709" soundfilename="AMEL4125">Was there something special about the Fountain's water?</String>
		<String _locID="34710" soundfilename="AMEL4130">All I know for sure is the Circle would return to find out.</String>
		<String _locID="34711" soundfilename="AMEL4200">Everyone always said Morgan's grandson John Black had a lot more enemies than he had friends.</String>
		<String _locID="34712" soundfilename="AMEL4205">But one man, a Mohawk named Kanyenke, always stood by his side -- even if the two did have a friendly rivalry.</String>
		<String _locID="34713" soundfilename="AMEL4300">I don't know exactly what happened on the mountain that day. But my grandfather wasn't the type to go down without a fight.</String>
		<String _locID="34714" soundfilename="AMEL4305">John Black may have made a lot of enemies in his life, but he died a hero. He knocked the Circle back on their heels so hard it would take them decades to recover.</String>
		<String _locID="34715" soundfilename="AMEL4310">By spring, Kanyenke had returned to his village. Life went on for the Iroquois, just as it had for years.</String>
		<String _locID="34716" soundfilename="AMEL4315">Except that his sister had given birth to John's son.</String>
		<String _locID="34717" soundfilename="AMEL4320">And though the Russians were gone, Kanyenke knew other white men would follow.</String>
		<String _locID="34718" soundfilename="AMEL4325">But until then, he would live, work, and help raise his sister's son...</String>
		<String _locID="34719" soundfilename="AMEL4330">... my father, Nathaniel Black.</String>
		<String _locID="34720" soundfilename="AMEL4400">John's sacrifice did not go unnoticed. My family was rewarded by the British government -- and later, the Americans. By the standards of those days, we got rich.</String>
		<String _locID="34721" soundfilename="AMEL4405">Those were eventful years. We pushed the frontier to the horizon -- building, expanding, heading west.</String>
		<String _locID="34722" soundfilename="AMEL4410">My father Nathaniel was a patriot, but not much of a businessman. By the time he left the company in my hands, the Black family fortune had dried up.</String>
		<String _locID="34723" soundfilename="AMEL4415">And so we come to my part of the story.</String>
		<String _locID="34724" soundfilename="AMEL4500">What I remember most about that day are the smells - black powder, sweat, and too much death.</String>
		<String _locID="34725" soundfilename="AMEL4505">Or maybe all I was smelling was that damn Beaumont.</String>
		<String _locID="34727" soundfilename="AMEL4515">Was the Fountain's water worth it all? I never found out.</String>
		<String _locID="34728" soundfilename="AMEL4520">What I did know was that the Circle had stored a lot of treasure in the Ossuary over the years.</String>
		<String _locID="34729" soundfilename="AMEL4525">Uncle Kanyenke said we shouldn't profit from the Circle's blood money, but most of the gold came from those Spanish treasure ships Morgan and Lizzie sank.</String>
		<String _locID="34730" soundfilename="AMEL4530">The way I figured it, the Circle of Ossus owed the Black family a little something. Don't you agree?</String>

		<String _locID="37437">Game Information: \n The Musketeer is an infantry unit with decent hitpoints, range and a good attack. They are one of the few units available to every Civilization and as such are one of the most common units in the game. \n \n Musketeers are a good all around unit, but not outstanding in any particular trait. Certain Civilizations, like the British, have unique improvements to Musketeers that make them even better than regular fully upgraded Musketeer infantry.</String>
		<String _locID="37438">About Musketeers: \n Musketeers were an infantry soldier who stood in ranks for two and three men deep, taking turns firing while other ranks reloaded. Muskets were drilled and disciplined to stand as close as 80 yards away from an enemy firing right back at them. Musket balls ranged from about 1/2" in diameter to 3/4" in diameter. Until long guns with rifled barrels that could be fired more than once every two minutes were developed, muskets were the ranged weapon of choice for infantry. \n \n Muskets had a relatively short range and were wildly inaccurate. Musketeers fought an awful lot like longbowmen, firing volley after volley in the direction of the enemy with no specific target. The barrage of lead was bound to hit something. A competent musketeer could fire 3 shots in a minute. Four times slower than a longbow and twice as fast as an early rifle.</String>

		<String _locID="38302">We can fill the British Museum with samples of these new wonders.</String>
		<String _locID="38303">A brave land to hold such discoveries!</String>
		<String _locID="38304">Well done! This should get you off to a quick start.</String>
		<String _locID="38305">Wondrous! With such wealth our cause surges forward.</String>
		<String _locID="38306">You certainly do not waste time getting started, do you?</String>
		<String _locID="38307">You seem to be a very efficient partner.</String>
		<String _locID="38308">You haven't gathered much treasure. I hope it's because you're building up a strong army somewhere.</String>
		<String _locID="38309">It's rather rude to seize treasure so close to your ally's town. I expect better behavior from you.</String>
		<String _locID="38310">I'm sure you won't mind me collecting treasure here, it's all for a good cause.</String>
		<String _locID="38311">Er... my explorer needs some rest. I won't be making many discoveries for a while.</String>
		<String _locID="38312">My exploration attempts are going to have to be on hold for a while - my explorer had a bit of a mishap.</String>
		<String _locID="38313">Alas, my explorer got caught in the open by enemies and now I cannot gather treasures until he is back.</String>
		<String _locID="38314">Your colony has not progressed to the next Age yet. I hope it's because you're busy building a large army.</String>
		<String _locID="38315">You progress at a remarkable rate. I trust you'll have enough troops to take advantage of your technology.</String>
		<String _locID="38316">That's a relief. I was wondering if you'd ever advance.</String>
		<String _locID="38317">Well done! It may be a moment before I can catch up with you.</String>
		<String _locID="38318">A fine show, my friend. Pray use your new research advantage to hinder our common foe.</String>
		<String _locID="38319">Soon you will have much more powerful troops than I. I will support you the best I can of course.</String>
		<String _locID="38320">I'm curious... did your battle plan include advancing to the next Age?</String>
		<String _locID="38321">Well, well. An enemy town left undefended. I thought you'd like to know.</String>
		<String _locID="38322">I have spotted an enemy town that doesn't even have a barracks. Our cavalry can run rampant.</String>
		<String _locID="38323">Here is an enemy town with no stable. Perhaps some artillery would be in order.</String>
		<String _locID="38324">Curse this wilderness! My explorer is down.</String>
		<String _locID="38325">They killed my explorer! Please teach them a lesson.</String>
		<String _locID="38326">It feels so good to get my explorer back.</String>
		<String _locID="38327">I have successfully brought my explorer back from the brink of death.</String>
		<String _locID="38328">I am sure your troops were on the way, but I've managed to free my explorer myself. Thanks anyway.</String>
		<String _locID="38329">You saved my explorer! Words cannot express my gratitude.</String>
		<String _locID="38330">You did what I could not. Rescued my explorer.</String>
		<String _locID="38331">Thank you ever so much. My newly-free explorer will work twice as hard to make up for lost time.</String>
		<String _locID="38332">Sadly, I was forced to ransom my explorer. The enemy rejoices.</String>
		<String _locID="38333">This is troubling... they are turning the natives against us.</String>
		<String _locID="38334">This battle is off to an excellent start. To victory!</String>
		<String _locID="38335">So far so good.</String>
		<String _locID="38336">I do not see how they can stop us now.</String>
		<String _locID="38337">This town needs a British flag... would you agree?</String>
		<String _locID="38338">It's time to take the war to the foe. Right about here.</String>
		<String _locID="38339">I plan to assault the main enemy base. Can you help?</String>
		<String _locID="38340">I have commanded my armies to attack here.</String>
		<String _locID="38341">My troops are going to target enemy settlers around the map.</String>
		<String _locID="38342">This trade site needs new management.</String>
		<String _locID="38344">It is time to expand my trading empire.</String>
		<String _locID="38345">I am constructing a military base here.</String>
		<String _locID="38346">These natives shall be useful allies.</String>
		<String _locID="38347">I need a town center here.</String>
		<String _locID="38348">That's one less enemy town befouling the landscape.</String>
		<String _locID="38349">That town was better defended than I had hoped.</String>
		<String _locID="38350">So far we are victorious! The enemy base is destroyed.</String>
		<String _locID="38351">The enemy base still stands. He is a tenacious fellow.</String>
		<String _locID="38352">The natives are free once again.</String>
		<String _locID="38353">I'll have to liberate those natives later.</String>
		<String _locID="38354">That's one less trade site for our enemies.</String>
		<String _locID="38355">Perhaps I should send a bigger army next time I attack a trading post.</String>
		<String _locID="38356">My troops shall defend this location.</String>
		<String _locID="38357">This building shall be protected.</String>
		<String _locID="38358">My armies shall defend this native village.</String>
		<String _locID="38359">This trading post shall not fall.</String>
		<String _locID="38360">This town is worth defending.</String>
		<String _locID="38361">I shall supply you with the finest in British cuisine.</String>
		<String _locID="38362">I shall supply you with shipments of wood.</String>
		<String _locID="38363">I shall deliver an endless stream of coin to you.</String>
		<String _locID="38364">Here is some food, eat it in good health.</String>
		<String _locID="38365">Here is some wood, compliments of the British Empire.</String>
		<String _locID="38366">Here is some coin, spend it wisely.</String>
		<String _locID="38367">It has been a noble fight, but I think we should cut our losses to fight again someday. Would you agree?</String>
		<String _locID="38368">Well, we can't win every battle. Perhaps next time we will be the victor. Shall we resign? I'll follow your lead.</String>
		<String _locID="38369">Things certainly aren't looking up - don't you think we should surrender while we can?</String>
		<String _locID="38370">This is absurd! We are wasting our energy... it's time to admit defeat.</String>
		<String _locID="38371">I'm sorry, but that just isn't possible.</String>
		<String _locID="38372">With all due respect, I am not allowed to do that.</String>
		<String _locID="38373">I would love to, but I cannot afford to comply with your request.</String>
		<String _locID="38374">I would comply immediately, if only I had enough troops.</String>
		<String _locID="38375">I have no army, so I cannot comply.</String>
		<String _locID="38376">As you wish.</String>
		<String _locID="38377">By your command.</String>
		<String _locID="38378">I hasten to obey.</String>
		<String _locID="38379">I shall train more cavalry.</String>
		<String _locID="38380">I shall expand my infantry.</String>
		<String _locID="38381">I shall manufacture artillery units.</String>
		<String _locID="38382">I shall make cavalry and some infantry.</String>
		<String _locID="38383">I shall make cavalry, and build a few artillery units.</String>
		<String _locID="38384">My line of infantry should be able to hold off anything they throw at us, with a few cannon to support them.</String>
		<String _locID="38385">I shall produce infantry alongside the best cavalry I can train.</String>
		<String _locID="38386">I shall manufacture artillery units, and add some cavalry to protect them.</String>
		<String _locID="38387">I shall manufacture artillery units, and protect them with infantry.</String>
		<String _locID="38388">We seem to be in command of the situation.</String>
		<String _locID="38389">We seem to be winning, and you deserve the credit</String>
		<String _locID="38390">We seem to be winning, in spite of your failures.</String>
		<String _locID="38391">I expect the French will resign soon.</String>
		<String _locID="38392">Looks like the Russians won't be in it much longer.</String>
		<String _locID="38393">I think we're winning, but the French might still cause us some problems.</String>
		<String _locID="38394">I'm sure we will win, but the Russians will offer some spirited resistance.</String>
		<String _locID="38395">I fear I may have doomed us to failure, despite your stellar performance.</String>
		<String _locID="38396">Your weaknesses have brought about my downfall.</String>
		<String _locID="38397">We may be losing, but I think we can take France down with us.</String>
		<String _locID="38398">We are beset with difficulties. Let us at least destroy the Russians before we go down to defeat.</String>
		<String _locID="38399">The enemy British have proven stronger than me, I fear.</String>
		<String _locID="38400">The situation looks bad, but I may see a way out - the enemy British are their weak link. Shall we strike?</String>
		<String _locID="38401">I hate to admit it, but the French may prevail.</String>
		<String _locID="38402">These are difficult times, my friend. Perhaps Russia is the nation of the future.</String>
		<String _locID="38403">My attack begins here.</String>
		<String _locID="38404">Trade routes are the lifeblood of a nation.</String>
		<String _locID="38405">I need to protect the few troops I have so far. Perhaps later I can assist you.</String>
		<String _locID="38406">I'm sorry but that is impossible for me.</String>
		<String _locID="38407">My caissons will soon go rolling along.</String>
		<String _locID="38408">I like horses, and I'm glad you do too.</String>
		<String _locID="38409">More footmen - the backbone of our army.</String>
		<String _locID="38410">How nice to get a settler without having to pay for him or ship him from overseas.</String>
		<String _locID="38411">Don't let it go to your head. You can't get enough gold that way to win the war.</String>
		<String _locID="38412">Food? How nice for you.</String>
		<String _locID="38413">I see you've rescued a local.</String>
		<String _locID="38414">Wood is good.</String>
		<String _locID="38415">It is time to expand my trading empire.</String>
		<String _locID="38416">It's almost embarrassing to find nice things like a free settler... but I'll take it.</String>
		<String _locID="38417">Free money!</String>
		<String _locID="38418">Let me know if you need any of this food.</String>
		<String _locID="38419">Help from the natives. I feel blessed indeed.</String>
		<String _locID="38420">More lumber to build our towns.</String>
		<String _locID="38421">Well! That was a close fight!</String>
		<String _locID="38422">It was touch and go there for a while.</String>
		<String _locID="38423">It was a near thing, but I've won!</String>
		<String _locID="38424">Actually, that fight was rather dull.</String>
		<String _locID="38425">No surprises there.</String>
		<String _locID="38426">I am going to raid the enemy gatherers.</String>
		<String _locID="38427">The enemy don't seem to be trying their hardest.</String>
		<String _locID="38428">It is time to wall in.</String>
		<String _locID="38429">I need more defenses.</String>
		<String _locID="38430">The enemy has four of a kind! We have to act fast!</String>
		<String _locID="38431">Uh-oh. We need to get our act together, and quickly!</String>
		<String _locID="38432">Now all we have to do is sit back and wait for victory to fall into our laps.</String>
		<String _locID="38433">How sweet - four of a kind!</String>
		<String _locID="38434">It's been so long since we got together, my friend. I see you have been successful in multiplayer.</String>
		<String _locID="38435">I've missed you. We really should fight on the same side more often.</String>
		<String _locID="38436">What happened? Your multiplayer score has plummeted!</String>
		<String _locID="38437">I am sorrowful. I had to buy back my explorer from the enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="38438">Poor baby! I see you have been losing a lot in multiplayer. Your score is so much lower than before.</String>
		<String _locID="38439">It's been soooo long since our last encounter. Have you been seeing someone else?</String>
		<String _locID="38440">You are so much more powerful and impressive than last time we met. This should be fun!</String>
		<String _locID="38441">This map? Again?</String>
		<String _locID="38442">We lost last time we were together. Let us learn from our mistakes.</String>
		<String _locID="38443">Last time we were allied, we did not do so well. I'm sure we'll work together much better now.</String>
		<String _locID="38444">I have every confidence we will win today, just like we did the last time I was here at your side.</String>
		<String _locID="38445">I feel a little embarrassed about my performance last game. Thank you for taking another chance on me.</String>
		<String _locID="38446">I hope you're able to do better than our last experience together.</String>
		<String _locID="38447">I didn't have the heart to defeat you in our last game. I'm glad we're on the same side now.</String>
		<String _locID="38448">Now they have the natives on their side.</String>
		<String _locID="38449">Remember when I crushed you last time? Ah... those were the days.</String>
		<String _locID="38450">How annoying. Now we have to start the countdown all over again.</String>
		<String _locID="38451">The enemy has already allied with the natives!</String>
		<String _locID="38452">The poor natives - they are being deluded by our enemy's lies.</String>
		<String _locID="38453">Now the foe has claimed a trade route. It seems like we are behind.</String>
		<String _locID="38454">The enemy has a trading post? Surely we can match him tit for tat.</String>
		<String _locID="38455">They have more native allies than we do. Shouldn't we be doing something about that?</String>
		<String _locID="38456">The enemy is certainly obsessive about hoarding trading sites.</String>
		<String _locID="38457">I am proud to see what you are doing. More natives means more warriors available to us.</String>
		<String _locID="38458">I am glad to see we are keeping ahead in the trade race.</String>
		<String _locID="38459">See here? A town, but no army to protect it!</String>
		<String _locID="38460">Now we have the first native allies! Wonderful!</String>
		<String _locID="38461">We are the first to claim a trade route.</String>
		<String _locID="38462">You can relax now. The threat is ended.</String>
		<String _locID="38463">I have enlisted the help of the natives.</String>
		<String _locID="38464">They say England is a nation of shopkeepers. Well, those shops power a great economy, and this trading post will do the same for us.</String>
		<String _locID="38465">See what I have done? Yet more natives to fight at our side.</String>
		<String _locID="38466">I am adding more trading posts to our string.</String>
		<String _locID="38467">We are in for a tougher fight than last time we met.</String>
		<String _locID="38468">This fight should be a lot less stressful than the last one.</String>
		<String _locID="38469">We are 60 seconds from losing. Shall we surrender now and spare ourselves the ignominy, or make one last push to overthrow the enemy's four of a kind?</String>
		<String _locID="38470">This town has no ability to train infantry. This means our cavalry should meet with little opposition.</String>
		<String _locID="38471">We are 60 seconds from victory! Let us enjoy the final moments of this contest by watching our enemy writhe in the agonies of his failure.</String>
		<String _locID="38472">Just one minute before our triumph, my friend! It may be a bit premature, but let me congratulate on a game well fought.</String>
		<String _locID="38473">Ack! I need help right here right now!</String>
		<String _locID="38474">I hate to bother you, but if you don't immediately send some troops to this point, I'm going to be in big trouble.</String>
		<String _locID="38475">Help is on the way.</String>
		<String _locID="38476">My forces are marching here as fast as they can.</String>
		<String _locID="38477">We are coming to back you up.</String>
		<String _locID="38478">No need to worry. My troops are on the way.</String>
		<String _locID="38479">Just hold out a little longer. I'm coming.</String>
		<String _locID="38480">We are coming to relieve your hard-fighting soldiers.</String>
		<String _locID="38481">Since this town does not have a stable, we should be safe sending in light troops and artillery to attack it.</String>
		<String _locID="38482">I am proud to be your ally in this struggle.</String>
		<String _locID="38483">Excuse me, but I'm a little short of coin at the moment. Can you spare some?</String>
		<String _locID="38484">I am embarrassed to admit it, but I don't have enough coin to accomplish this task. Can you send me some?</String>
		<String _locID="38485">My people are hungry. Do you have any extra food?</String>
		<String _locID="38486">I have a food shortage. Can you spare some?</String>
		<String _locID="38487">I can't seem to cut down trees fast enough. Please send me some wood if you can.</String>
		<String _locID="38488">I need you to give me some wood, dear.</String>
		<String _locID="38489">Thanks so much. I couldn't have held out much longer.</String>
		<String _locID="38490">I really appreciate the help you gave me back there.</String>
		<String _locID="38491">My gratitude for the aid you rendered my base.</String>
		<String _locID="38492">The enemy murdered my explorer!</String>
		<String _locID="38493">My royal thanks for helping me win this victory.</String>
		<String _locID="38494">We could never have won this fight without your timely aid.</String>
		<String _locID="38495">This team up may have won us the war.</String>
		<String _locID="38496">Thank you ever so much for the coin.</String>
		<String _locID="38497">We give thanks for all the resources.</String>
		<String _locID="38498">This food is great! It really hits the spot.</String>
		<String _locID="38499">Now I can build what I need.</String>
		<String _locID="38500">I think you have bitten off more than you can chew, my friend. Perhaps a strategic withdrawal is in order.</String>
		<String _locID="38501">This fight is too much for you. Pull back for now, and return when you are stronger.</String>
		<String _locID="38502">Send in more cannon and field pieces, my friend! I believe that would bring victor!</String>
		<String _locID="38503">My explorer has been lost to the enemy!</String>
		<String _locID="38504">You seem to have a shortage of cannon and shot - perhaps if you had more artillery you would do better.</String>
		<String _locID="38505">Ride them down! Oh... wait. You don't have enough cavalry. Perhaps you should rectify that error.</String>
		<String _locID="38506">If only we had access to more cavalry, I think we could defeat them.</String>
		<String _locID="38507">We cannot stand up to the enemy unless we can get more infantry into the fight.</String>
		<String _locID="38508">See what the foe is sending against us? We could defeat them if only we had more infantry.</String>
		<String _locID="38509">So... read any good books lately?</String>
		<String _locID="38510">War: a series of catastrophes which result in peace.</String>
		<String _locID="38511">You can see civilization advancing - in every war you get killed in a new way.</String>
		<String _locID="38512">Have at you!</String>
		<String _locID="38513">Take THAT!</String>
		<String _locID="38514">I am about to bring the war to our foe. Follow my lead.</String>
		<String _locID="38515">It is dangerous here on the frontier! Now my explorer has been incapacitated.</String>
		<String _locID="38516">Surprise!</String>
		<String _locID="38517">An extra settler or two can do you no real good.</String>
		<String _locID="38518">A few driblets of coin here and there will not change the outcome.</String>
		<String _locID="38519">A bit of extra food can't help you.</String>
		<String _locID="38520">One warrior, more or less, does not make an army.</String>
		<String _locID="38521">Wood? What can you do with that?</String>
		<String _locID="38522">My empire grows more quickly than ever!</String>
		<String _locID="38523">Ah... riches.</String>
		<String _locID="38524">Food just seems to drop out of the trees for me.</String>
		<String _locID="38525">Even the natives want to join my side. I guess they sense who is likelier to win.</String>
		<String _locID="38526">It's nice to get wood without all that lumberjack labor.</String>
		<String _locID="38527">As I expected, the victory is mine.</String>
		<String _locID="38528">To the victor belong the spoils.</String>
		<String _locID="38529">What a disaster! You are a tough opponent.</String>
		<String _locID="38530">Ouch. Perhaps you could go easier on me next time?</String>
		<String _locID="38531">You have been practicing. Your rating has jumped up since last we met.</String>
		<String _locID="38532">You poor soul. I see your multiplayer score has dropped. Should I take it easy on you this time around?</String>
		<String _locID="38533">It seems like weeks since last we met.</String>
		<String _locID="38534">This same map?! Again?</String>
		<String _locID="38535">Couldn't you take the pressure? I see you've tilted the odds more in your favor this game.</String>
		<String _locID="38536">You are brave to face more enemies than your last game.</String>
		<String _locID="38537">The fight is not over yet. Your stupid timer does not mean we are tossing in the towel.</String>
		<String _locID="38539">All those trading posts! Which one shall I destroy first?</String>
		<String _locID="38540">Haha! Now you will have to start over again.</String>
		<String _locID="38541">You didn't need those particular natives, did you?</String>
		<String _locID="38542">Down with the usurper! I mean you, of course.</String>
		<String _locID="38543">Great Britain feels it necessary to inform you that your trading post is no more. (laughs)</String>
		<String _locID="38545">I got the first trade site! Victory is assured!</String>
		<String _locID="38546">Those walls are so decorative. I hope you don't think they'll be practical as well.</String>
		<String _locID="38547">I like the way your walls look. I'll be careful only to poke a few holes in them.</String>
		<String _locID="38548">You certainly are quick to claim the natives. Afraid I'd get there first?</String>
		<String _locID="38549">You already need a trading post? Mismanage something early on, did you?</String>
		<String _locID="38550">What did those hapless natives ever do to you?</String>
		<String _locID="38551">Aren't you supposed to be fighting soldiers, not mere trading sites?</String>
		<String _locID="38552">I wish you'd stop trespassing on my property. Look. Now you've broken it.</String>
		<String _locID="38553">Well... it was fun while it lasted.</String>
		<String _locID="38554">You have given me a higher difficulty rating. This time I should put up a real challenge for you.</String>
		<String _locID="38555">Even at this new, lower, difficulty rating, I trust I will be able to put up a good fight for you.</String>
		<String _locID="38556">Hear that? The clock is ticking now. Just a few short minutes and you lose!</String>
		<String _locID="38557">It seems there is nothing I can do to keep you from winning. But there is still a little time for me to take action.</String>
		<String _locID="38558">Look at the timer. Tick, tick, tick. The countdown to doom.</String>
		<String _locID="38559">That treasure is now mine by right of armed conquest.</String>
		<String _locID="38560">How adorable. You have sent soldiers to try to invade my town.</String>
		<String _locID="38561">I can see your army wandering about aimlessly.</String>
		<String _locID="38562">I can see your explorer now.</String>
		<String _locID="38563">These are dark times. I regret the necessity of annihilating you.</String>
		<String _locID="38564">You can save your men's lives by giving up now.</String>
		<String _locID="38565">It seems I have the upper edge on you. How nice.</String>
		<String _locID="38566">I must say it is a pleasure to see your soldiers take to their heels.</String>
		<String _locID="38567">Look at the size of this fight. EVERYONE wants to get in on the action!</String>
		<String _locID="38568">Feeling standoffish? I notice the new walls around your base.</String>
		<String _locID="38569">Do you think they're going to try to raid us? I see your walls.</String>
		<String _locID="38570">Those false British are just about out of the door. Your troops plus my loyalists have shown them up.</String>
		<String _locID="38571">As we should have expected, the British are stout opponents. Luckily you have some British on your side as well.</String>
		<String _locID="38572">I have fought tougher Dutch than these before. These just seem to cave right in when we attack.</String>
		<String _locID="38573">It is exceedingly irritating that the Dutch are so stubborn.</String>
		<String _locID="38574">The Germans cannot stand up to my fine lobsterbacks.</String>
		<String _locID="38575">What can we do about the Germans?</String>
		<String _locID="38578">I believe the Portuguese have been put paid to.</String>
		<String _locID="38579">The Portuguese are a real problem. Do you have any suggestions for how to deal with them?</String>
		<String _locID="38580">Well at least the Spanish are practically down for the count.</String>
		<String _locID="38581">The Spanish are proving to be redoubtable foemen. I hope you can see the way to overcome their might.</String>
		<String _locID="38582">Emergency! The enemy is hitting me hard!</String>
		<String _locID="38583">Who knew the Dutch would prove so strong?</String>
		<String _locID="38584">We might lose, but the Dutch are as weak as we.</String>
		<String _locID="38585">The German army is old-fashioned and out of date. Let us destroy them before we ourselves are destroyed.</String>
		<String _locID="38586">I did what I could, but it was not enough to enable us to win.</String>
		<String _locID="38587">Your weaknesses have brought about my downfall.</String>
		<String _locID="38589">The Turks are the most vulnerable enemy we have. Let us see if they can be destroyed before we are.</String>
		<String _locID="38590">In past decades, Portugal had often proved a powerful ally to England. Sadly, it seems that Portugal is equally powerful as a foe.</String>
		<String _locID="38591">Even though we're the underdogs in this fight, I think we can at least take the Portuguese down with us.</String>
		<String _locID="38592">It certainly looks like the Spanish are going to have vengeance for our sinking their Armada back in 1588.</String>
		<String _locID="38593">Things look bad. But the Spanish house seems rather rotten, if you get my meaning. Let us kick in their doors!</String>
		<String _locID="38594">Curses! Now another of them has joined the fray. We need more troops to counter them!</String>
		<String _locID="38595">We kill them and kill them, and yet more keep coming. What can we do?</String>
		<String _locID="38596">Excellent! You have gathered your troops together so we can destroy them all at once. How thoughtful.</String>
		<String _locID="38597">We  gathered our troops together here specifically in hopes that you would gather yours together to face us. Thank you for obliging us.</String>
		<String _locID="38598">We make a good team, my friend. Let us march forward, arm in arm, to our certain triumph.</String>
		<String _locID="38599">All is well at this time. We must still be vigilant, but I believe the outcome of this war will be favorable.</String>
		<String _locID="38600">Well, the enemy is slipping behind. You have been of some assistance, at least.</String>
		<String _locID="38601">The foe is almost beaten. It is safe for you to start fighting now.</String>
		<String _locID="38602">I think this war has turned in our favor, thanks to you.</String>
		<String _locID="38603">Your strength has carried this alliance. I thank you from the bottom of my heart.</String>
		<String _locID="38604">You may have forgotten about me, but I have not forgotten about you.</String>
		<String _locID="38605">Thank you for the respite from combat. I can use this extra time to prepare for your defeat.</String>
		<String _locID="38606">Are you trying to hide? I see no signs of life.</String>
		<String _locID="38607">That's hardly cricket, is it? Teaming up against me?</String>
		<String _locID="38608">It takes two of you to defeat me? What kind of soldier are you, anyway?</String>
		<String _locID="38609">Now you see our true power. We fight as a team, my ally and I. You cannot stop us both!</String>
		<String _locID="38610">You thought you had me didn't you? Admit it. You didn't reckon on reinforcements!</String>
		<String _locID="38611">Excellent! You have gathered your troops together so we can destroy them all at once. How thoughtful.</String>
		<String _locID="38612">We  gathered our troops here specifically in hope that you would gather yours together to face us. Thank you for obliging us.</String>
		<String _locID="38613">Perhaps I can at least retrieve some dignity out of this debacle. Kind sir, will you accept my surrender?</String>
		<String _locID="38614">No more native allies for our enemy after this attack!</String>
		<String _locID="38616">Nothing I can do can save my town now. I am doomed. There is nothing but surrender left to me. Will you accept it?</String>
		<String _locID="38617">My explorer has been hurt. I don't suppose you could spare a soldier or two to help him back into action?</String>
		<String _locID="38618">You have failed. I have successfully retrieved my explorer.</String>
		<String _locID="38619">You could not hold my crafty explorer for long.</String>
		<String _locID="38620">My explorer is back with me and as good as new.</String>
		<String _locID="38621">Your native allies cannot save you.</String>
		<String _locID="38622">I didn't want that particular native town anyway.</String>
		<String _locID="38623">What do you think you are doing? Killing settlers violates all civilized laws of war.</String>
		<String _locID="38624">Stop chasing my settlers at once. You have fair warning.</String>
		<String _locID="38625">I warn you. Continue raiding my settlers and I shall respond in kind.</String>
		<String _locID="38626">I shall destroy the enemy trading post here.</String>
		<String _locID="38627">Your army may be massive, but my heart is pure, and my soldiers each fight with the strength of ten.</String>
		<String _locID="38628">You certainly have a lot of soldiers. I suspect this means you've skimped on equipping and training them.</String>
		<String _locID="38629">Hmm. Nice large army. Let's see how it holds up in battle.</String>
		<String _locID="38630">Your army doesn't seem quite large enough to  be a threat. I wonder what you plan to do with it.</String>
		<String _locID="38631">I see your force maneuvering in the wilderness. Perhaps it's worth my while to destroy it.</String>
		<String _locID="38632">I doubt you dare attack me with an army that size.</String>
		<String _locID="38633">You'd better pick up your toys and scurry home.</String>
		<String _locID="38634">What a tiny army! Is this a trick of some kind?</String>
		<String _locID="38635">I imagine the reason your army is so small is that you'd hoped in vain that it would escape notice.</String>
		<String _locID="38636">You are causing me serious discomfort.</String>
		<String _locID="38637">I want a base here. Soon it will teem with soldiers.</String>
		<String _locID="38638">Please... have mercy!</String>
		<String _locID="38639">Can we discuss a temporary cease fire? Perhaps your troops could use a break from their labors.</String>
		<String _locID="38640">Your town is rather out on a limb, isn't it?</String>
		<String _locID="38641">Feeling standoffish I see - didn't want to be too near your smelly old neighbors?</String>
		<String _locID="38642">I can see your town now. My soldiers know where to head!</String>
		<String _locID="38643">Thank you for putting your town in such an obvious spot. It was easy to discover.</String>
		<String _locID="38644">You must be afraid of me - your towns are so near to one another.</String>
		<String _locID="38645">You built so very very near your ally. I wonder if it is some kind of strange plan, or just a mistake?</String>
		<String _locID="38646">Did you forget something? Like progressing in Age?</String>
		<String _locID="38647">You certainly are quick to jump up in Age. I suspect this indicates that your economy is lagging well behind mine.</String>
		<String _locID="38648">I am going to build a town here.</String>
		<String _locID="38649">What took you so long to reach Colonial?</String>
		<String _locID="38650">Still in the Discovery Age?! Haven't you discovered enough, yet?</String>
		<String _locID="38651">How impolite. That treasure was clearly intended for me.</String>
		<String _locID="38652">Off to a good beginning!</String>
		<String _locID="38653">You have scooped up so many treasures. What a fine fellow!</String>
		<String _locID="38654">I appreciate your letting me collect all the treasure, but I have enough. Really. You can get some now if you like.</String>
		<String _locID="38655">A fine treasure indeed. I can't imagine why you hadn't gathered it already.</String>
		<String _locID="38656">You have done a good job with your colony so far. But not good enough.</String>
		<String _locID="38657">Now that you are so far advanced in Age, your uniforms must seem fine indeed. But I doubt your fighting quality has improved.</String>
		<String _locID="38658">My next town center is to be at this location.</String>
		<String _locID="38659">I am impressed by your speed in advancing your colony. But not frightened.</String>
		<String _locID="38660">Your success in making discoveries may help console you when you have lost the war.</String>
		<String _locID="38661">I see you are wasting your time on penny-ante looting.</String>
		<String _locID="38662">A paltry treasure here or there makes no difference in the long run.</String>
		<String _locID="38663">You are so backward! What will your soldiers use to fight mine? Clubs?</String>
		<String _locID="38664">You are so nice, to choose to fight me while you are an Age inferior. How sweet.</String>
		<String _locID="38665">I suppose I should congratulate you.</String>
		<String _locID="38666">So soon? I must marshal my forces.</String>
		<String _locID="38667">At last you have joined the rest of us in the Commerce Age.</String>
		<String _locID="38668">How quaint. We are all moving on to the next Age.</String>
		<String _locID="38669">Native warriors are brave and resourceful.</String>
		<String _locID="38670">Are you aware that it is possible to advance to the Commerce Age?</String>
		<String _locID="38671">Still back in the Discovery Age?! How delightful.</String>
		<String _locID="38672">This wealth will go straight into my war chest.</String>
		<String _locID="38673">See how my explorer makes good use of his time? You can learn by my example.</String>
		<String _locID="38674">Every time I make such a lucrative discovery, it's one less find for you.</String>
		<String _locID="38675">That's pretty bold of you, coming that near to my base.</String>
		<String _locID="38676">What daring! Stealing a treasure from under my very nose!</String>
		<String _locID="38677">You made the first find?! Hmph. Beginner's luck.</String>
		<String _locID="38678">Don't you realize that these paltry treasures don't count in the long run?</String>
		<String _locID="38679">You are good at exploring the wilderness, but other skills will be needed once the fighting begins in earnest.</String>
		<String _locID="38680">The native tribes will be good to have at our side.</String>
		<String _locID="38681">You must have a lot of time on your hands, to waste it gathering treasures.</String>
		<String _locID="38682">Can't you find anything? Perhaps it's because my gallant explorer has already gathered up all the treasures.</String>
		<String _locID="38683">I really appreciate your leaving all the treasure-gathering to me. It's too kind.</String>
		<String _locID="38684">Heehee! I have stolen one of your treasures right from under your nose!</String>
		<String _locID="38685">Saving that treasure for later? Too late now!</String>
		<String _locID="38686">I feel bad about this, but I don't have enough resources to obey you.</String>
		<String _locID="38687">Sorry. I'm too poor to do that.</String>
		<String _locID="38688">I have not trained an army yet.</String>
		<String _locID="38689">Sorry, I don't have any troops.</String>
		<String _locID="38690">If I had a few more men, they would rush to your aid.</String>
		<String _locID="38691">Alas, we have all but lost. I regret I was not a more useful ally to you.</String>
		<String _locID="38692">In a minute it will all be over. Next time I will apply myself more effectively.</String>
		<String _locID="38693">(laughs) You fought magnificently. Victory will be ours in moments.</String>
		<String _locID="38694">Prepare to celebrate. In one minute we will have won.</String>
		<String _locID="38695">Your sovereign remedy for this battle is to field more artillery units!</String>
		<String _locID="38696">I suggest you construct additional artillery units.</String>
		<String _locID="38697">I recommend you bring more cavalry to bear in this battle at once.</String>
		<String _locID="38698">Cavalry, commander! You need more cavalry in that fight!</String>
		<String _locID="38699">Your forces in this battle need more infantry units.</String>
		<String _locID="38700">If you field more infantry for that battle you'll fare better.</String>
		<String _locID="38701">He who defends everything defends nothing. I strongly suggest retreat.</String>
		<String _locID="38702">Unless you want to lose every soldier in that army, I recommend you retreat now.</String>
		<String _locID="38703">The clash of several armies shatters the lands. Guard against a decisive blow!</String>
		<String _locID="38704">Troops from several armies fight here. We must coordinate our efforts to wrench victory from this chaos.</String>
		<String _locID="38705">To defeat you I applied one of my most fundamental principles: I attacked briskly and with good order, always endeavoring to gain ground.</String>
		<String _locID="38706">It has been my military tradition to win. Yours is shaping up to be defeated.</String>
		<String _locID="38707">The outcome of that battle has left me speechless. However, the outcome of the war will speak of my victory.</String>
		<String _locID="38708">That battle was not one I care to have the history books learn about.</String>
		<String _locID="38709">My bold attitude alone would have been enough to win that battle.</String>
		<String _locID="38710">I presume you foresaw the outcome of that battle as plainly as I did: victory.</String>
		<String _locID="38711">I am pleased with the outcome of that fight after all.</String>
		<String _locID="38712">In the battle at hand our enemy shall feel the imposition of my heel upon his face.</String>
		<String _locID="38713">My reputation alone would be enough to rout their army in this fight.</String>
		<String _locID="38714">Your arrival was timely; the battle is turning in our favor.</String>
		<String _locID="38715">I have to admit I am very glad you have arrived.</String>
		<String _locID="38716">Alert, my ally -- an additional opponent has joined the fray and our prospects for victory here fade quickly!</String>
		<String _locID="38717">The battle is going against us.</String>
		<String _locID="38718">This will be a bitter conflict; the enemy's numbers have increased.</String>
		<String _locID="38719">We now face another foe as well.</String>
		<String _locID="38720">Of course.</String>
		<String _locID="38721">Yes, your request is exactly what I would have suggested.</String>
		<String _locID="38722">Not an issue. I'll comply.</String>
		<String _locID="38723">Yes.</String>
		<String _locID="38724">Construction of artillery to commence.</String>
		<String _locID="38725">Request to train artillery acknowledged. Will do.</String>
		<String _locID="38726">Yes. Artillery lends dignity to what might otherwise be a vulgar brawl.</String>
		<String _locID="38727">Agree. Great guns are the most respectable argument.</String>
		<String _locID="38728">Artillery units and cavalry support shall be provided.</String>
		<String _locID="38729">Artillery units are an outstanding option. I'll train cavalry units as well.</String>
		<String _locID="38730">Agreed. Artillery and infantry support troops shall be provided.</String>
		<String _locID="38731">Yes, artillery and infantry units on their way.</String>
		<String _locID="38732">At once. You need additional cavalry and I will supply them.</String>
		<String _locID="38733">Cavalry units shall be trained and fielded at once.</String>
		<String _locID="38734">Cavalry units shall be provided along with some artillery.</String>
		<String _locID="38735">I shall create some cavalry and artillery. Use them wisely.</String>
		<String _locID="38736">Without essential cavalry and footsoldiers an army is nothing. I will provide both for you as requested.</String>
		<String _locID="38737">My infantry and cavalry units are on their way.</String>
		<String _locID="38738">I agree with your recommendation. Infantry presence on the battlefield will be increased.</String>
		<String _locID="38739">Yes, I'll recruit more infantry units.</String>
		<String _locID="38740">Strategically sound. I can agree to train more infantry and a few artillery units as well.</String>
		<String _locID="38741">I will. Infantry and supporting artillery are vital elements in a conquering army.</String>
		<String _locID="38742">I concur. Infantry and cavalry shall be added to my army.</String>
		<String _locID="38743">Well-trained footsoldiers and elite cavalry units will be fielded.</String>
		<String _locID="38744">Without supplies, no army is brave. I will not leave my troops cowering so I must deny your request for resources.</String>
		<String _locID="38745">I cannot comply at the moment.</String>
		<String _locID="38746">I cannot spare the resources.</String>
		<String _locID="38747">I can spare advice, but not resources.</String>
		<String _locID="38748">To that request I cannot concur.</String>
		<String _locID="38749">I cannot comply.</String>
		<String _locID="38750">No. My priorities are elsewhere at the moment.</String>
		<String _locID="38751">There is no way I can do that at this time.</String>
		<String _locID="38752">There will be no push of bayonets from me -- I have no army.</String>
		<String _locID="38753">My empire has no army at the moment.</String>
		<String _locID="38754">As soon as I have trained sufficient forces I can assist you. At present I have none.</String>
		<String _locID="38755">My soldiers are not ready to enter battle.</String>
		<String _locID="38756">That request is beyond even me. No.</String>
		<String _locID="38757">I am afraid that is not something I can do.</String>
		<String _locID="38758">That won't be possible.</String>
		<String _locID="38759">I have determined that is impossible.</String>
		<String _locID="38760">My army is of insufficient size to comply.</String>
		<String _locID="38761">Write to me again after I have actually assembled an army.</String>
		<String _locID="38762">Our enemy has destroyed one of our trading posts, but this war is far from over.</String>
		<String _locID="38763">We almost conquered them unconventionally. We'll just have to do it the ordinary way this time.</String>
		<String _locID="38764">For a moment there it looked like we might defeat them that way.</String>
		<String _locID="38765">Our enemy managed to stop our monopoly. We'll just have to conquer them another way.</String>
		<String _locID="38766">Our British opponent is nearly routed. Perhaps they will be able to construct a raft from broken muskets on which to sail home to their frail island.</String>
		<String _locID="38767">It looks like we've taken the pluck out of plucky little Britain.</String>
		<String _locID="38768">The British era of conquest and colonization is over.</String>
		<String _locID="38769">Although the British have all but lost this battle, at least they have their soggy little rock to swim home to.</String>
		<String _locID="38770">Our Dutch foe is about to fall. They will soon be forced to return in shame to the lagoon they call a country.</String>
		<String _locID="38771">Plainly the Dutch are about to collapse under our onslaught. All they will have left to be proud of are their wooden shoes.</String>
		<String _locID="38772">If the Dutch had spent less time doting over their tulips and more time training their soldiers, they might have had a chance.</String>
		<String _locID="38773">The Dutch really should focus on building windmills. Clearly they know very little about warfare.</String>
		<String _locID="38774">It is all but over for the French.</String>
		<String _locID="38775">The French may have been fearsome at one time, but after this battle I'd suggest they just stay in the kitchen.</String>
		<String _locID="38776">The French used to be dangerous. At this point I'd only call them frightful.</String>
		<String _locID="38777">Some dominating military power the French have turned out to be. Their croissants would probably put up more of a fight.</String>
		<String _locID="38778">Our German opponent has all but lost.</String>
		<String _locID="38779">Our German foe has nearly been defeated. They should hang their heads in shame.</String>
		<String _locID="38780">Since I was not leading their armies, it doesn't surprise me to see our German enemy is nearly defeated.</String>
		<String _locID="38781">The Ottoman foe is almost defeated.</String>
		<String _locID="38782">The Ottomans are almost destroyed. I hope they have some camels left to ride home on.</String>
		<String _locID="38783">It looks like the Ottomans have run out of tricks. I wonder if they will try to sell some of their cannon at a yard sale?</String>
		<String _locID="38784">The Ottomans have just about run out of gunpowder. And everything else.</String>
		<String _locID="38785">Our Portuguese opponent has almost fallen.</String>
		<String _locID="38786">The Portuguese have been nearly beaten.</String>
		<String _locID="38787">It looks like the Portuguese have just about had it. They should probably just stick with fishing.</String>
		<String _locID="38788">Our armies have just about rolled our Portuguese foe.</String>
		<String _locID="38789">The Russians were worthy opponents, but they have all but lost this war.</String>
		<String _locID="38790">I thought we would never see an end to the Russian soldiers, but that well has just about dried up now.</String>
		<String _locID="38791">The Russians kept on coming, but now they are just doing a lot of dying.</String>
		<String _locID="38792">You would think that with a motherland the size of Russia's that they could maintain a serious attack, but it looks like they are close to defeat.</String>
		<String _locID="38793">The Spanish are about to concede defeat, I would wager.</String>
		<String _locID="38794">It looks like the Spanish have had it with fighting.</String>
		<String _locID="38795">The Spanish are good at fighting bulls, but it looks like they have some things to learn about fighting men.</String>
		<String _locID="38796">The Spanish were worthy foes, but we've pounded the fight out of them.</String>
		<String _locID="38797">I never underestimate a foe, but I am surprised at the tenacity of our British opponent.</String>
		<String _locID="38798">The British are putting up a remarkable fight, even if they do live on a wet rock in the middle of the sea.</String>
		<String _locID="38799">I don't know how the British can be fighting so well. Didn't anyone tell them they were not allowed off their little island?</String>
		<String _locID="38800">The Dutch always surprise me. A land of flowers and windmills, yet they challenge even such as I.</String>
		<String _locID="38801">Don't the Dutch have anything better to do than fight in the New World? Although, I must say they are doing it very well.</String>
		<String _locID="38802">Our French enemy is showing exceptional resolve in this conflict.</String>
		<String _locID="38803">Whoever is commanding the French knows what he or she is doing.</String>
		<String _locID="38804">The French are fighting as fiercely as my own troops. We must be wary of him.</String>
		<String _locID="38805">I do not want to believe it, but I must accept the fact: the French are a potent force in this conflict.</String>
		<String _locID="38806">The Germans are never to be trifled with, but this opponent is exceptional.</String>
		<String _locID="38807">The enemy Germans are fighting like they were commanded by me. I don't like it.</String>
		<String _locID="38808">If we do not defeat the Ottomans quickly we may find them knocking at our own doors.</String>
		<String _locID="38809">Our Ottoman foe is potent. We'll have to deal with him very carefully.</String>
		<String _locID="38810">Our Portuguese opponent is mighty. We'll have to apply all of my strategic brilliance to defeat them.</String>
		<String _locID="38811">We cannot underestimate the Portuguese. At least, we had better not.</String>
		<String _locID="38812">Where the Portuguese are concerned I do not feel so bold. They are worthy foes.</String>
		<String _locID="38813">The Russians are fighting with a ferocity I might not have expected from them. They are truly dangerous.</String>
		<String _locID="38814">Whoever is leading the Russians is impressing even me. We must be careful.</String>
		<String _locID="38815">We must not underestimate our Spanish opponent -- they are demonstrating great resolve.</String>
		<String _locID="38816">The Spanish are strong; we must handle them carefully.</String>
		<String _locID="38817">Although I never doubt our eventual victory, I can see that the Spanish are not going to take our conquest lying down.</String>
		<String _locID="38818">The Spanish seem to have a military answer for every action we take. This may not be as easy as I thought.</String>
		<String _locID="38819">You have advanced long before I have chosen to, but do not fire until you see the whites of their eyes!</String>
		<String _locID="38820">You are wise to advance your colony. Use the new technologies it affords you to decimate our foes.</String>
		<String _locID="38821">You are ahead of me, my ally. I will endeavor to catch up.</String>
		<String _locID="38822">Observe; they have captured the cooperation of some natives.</String>
		<String _locID="38823">They have built a trading post at a native village. Let us make it a point to destroy it as soon as possible.</String>
		<String _locID="38824">I admire unusual strategies, but I am at a loss to know what strategy delaying your Age advancement could belong to.</String>
		<String _locID="38825">You are still in the Discovery Age. Surely you will want an army when our enemy comes to visit?</String>
		<String _locID="38826">It is difficult to defend one's town while in the Discovery Age. Perhaps it is time to advance.</String>
		<String _locID="38827">To do that which your enemy least expects is brilliant, but I don't know if choosing not to advance to the next Age would fall under that category.</String>
		<String _locID="38828">I suggest you follow my lead and advance to the next Age as soon as possible.</String>
		<String _locID="38829">Exploring the New World is fine, but if you do not advance to the next Age soon, you may find your explorer fighting the enemy single-handed.</String>
		<String _locID="38830">Remarkable work. Continue to use your resources as wisely as I do, and we shall be assured victory.</String>
		<String _locID="38831">Excellent. You have reached the Commerce Age quickly.</String>
		<String _locID="38832">Your advancement to the next Age is an inspiration to my men.</String>
		<String _locID="38833">Although I advanced an Age before you, I expect your assistance in this war may still contribute to our eventual victory.</String>
		<String _locID="38834">Not everyone is Frederick the Great.</String>
		<String _locID="38835">Excellent. You may still fight by my side.</String>
		<String _locID="38836">To express my gratitude for rescuing our explorer I shall have a new sapling planted in the Black Forest.</String>
		<String _locID="38837">My troops have destroyed a trading post. We are no longer threatened by defeat in that manner.</String>
		<String _locID="38838">The natives in this realm have been freed by my decisive action.</String>
		<String _locID="38839">This opponent has lost a town to my army. Unfortunate for him, but only to be expected.</String>
		<String _locID="38840">Not surprisingly, I have destroyed another enemy building. In this case, on a trade site.</String>
		<String _locID="38841">I tried to free those natives but was waylaid.</String>
		<String _locID="38842">The enemy town was not razed by my forces. I may need a new stratagem.</String>
		<String _locID="38843">I regret to inform you that my assault on that trading post failed.</String>
		<String _locID="38844">My explorer is down and therefore cannot gather treasures. We may have to increase our efforts in other areas until he is rescued.</String>
		<String _locID="38845">The New World holds a variety of dangers. My explorer has fallen even though off the battlefield.</String>
		<String _locID="38846">In the face of this storm, I believe we have met our match.</String>
		<String _locID="38847">Request military assistance here immediately.</String>
		<String _locID="38848">Alert, my ally! Enemy forces are at my gates.</String>
		<String _locID="38849">Bayonets are at our throats! I need assistance in my town now!</String>
		<String _locID="38850">Request to bring your army to the aid of my town at once!</String>
		<String _locID="38851">Your presence lends a dignity to our alliance.</String>
		<String _locID="38852">It shall be an honor to fight by your side.</String>
		<String _locID="38853">Together we shall present a terrifying sight to our enemy's gaze.</String>
		<String _locID="38854">For this alliance I predict only victory and glory.</String>
		<String _locID="38855">Our alliance in this conflict will clearly result in the destruction of our foes.</String>
		<String _locID="38856">Together we will present a storm of destruction for our enemies.</String>
		<String _locID="38857">Ah, the challenge is increasing. It approaches a level worthy of my genius.</String>
		<String _locID="38858">The challenge has been reduced. One hemisphere of my superior brain can take a vacation and we will still be triumphant.</String>
		<String _locID="38859">As a foe you earned my respect. I trust you will display similar talent as my ally.</String>
		<String _locID="38860">You showed exceptional promise in our last battle. Together our combined brilliance will vanquish any enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="38861">Although you had little hope of defeating me in our prior encounter, as an ally you now have an opportunity to observe my genius directly.</String>
		<String _locID="38862">This time, remember this if nothing else: He who defends everything defends nothing.</String>
		<String _locID="38863">I see fate has thrown us again into the same territory of the New World.</String>
		<String _locID="38864">Perhaps this time we should make this agreement: you are to request what you please, and I am to do what I please.</String>
		<String _locID="38865">As in our previous victory, no matter the outcome, I will continue to think, live, and die as a king.</String>
		<String _locID="38866">I elected to ransom my explorer.</String>
		<String _locID="38867">Not surprisingly, the enemy was unable to stop me from rescuing my explorer.</String>
		<String _locID="38868">I have gained visibility to an enemy base. Can you comprehend that there is no army defending it?</String>
		<String _locID="38869">One of our enemy's bases has no barracks.</String>
		<String _locID="38870">Be informed that an enemy town is devoid of a stable.</String>
		<String _locID="38871">I expect this coin to be used prudently.</String>
		<String _locID="38872">Take this food and make sure each soldier gets some.</String>
		<String _locID="38873">Some of this wood comes from the Black Forest, but all of it is useful to our cause.</String>
		<String _locID="38874">I've given the order to attack here.</String>
		<String _locID="38875">Our enemy's economy is a weak point, so I intend to raid settlers now.</String>
		<String _locID="38876">I have issued the command to attack the main town immediately.</String>
		<String _locID="38877">These natives will be grateful to ally with us after I free them from our enemies.</String>
		<String _locID="38878">My forces are on their way to attack this trading post.</String>
		<String _locID="38879">Continue your assault; I have sent troops to assist you against the trading post.</String>
		<String _locID="38880">This is an strategic place for a military base. I shall build one.</String>
		<String _locID="38881">A town center will be constructed here by my settlers.</String>
		<String _locID="38882">Note that I am pursing the construction of a trading post at this native village.</String>
		<String _locID="38883">I know of a trading site that would be improved with a German flag over it.</String>
		<String _locID="38884">A regiment of my forces have been assigned to defend this building.</String>
		<String _locID="38885">Some of my forces will protect this location.</String>
		<String _locID="38886">These natives and their village are under my protection.</String>
		<String _locID="38887">It would be foolish to let this town fall, so I will not allow it.</String>
		<String _locID="38888">I refuse to relinquish this trading post to the enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="38889">Expect coin to flow steadily from my coffers into yours.</String>
		<String _locID="38890">I will continue to send you food, and also sauerkraut.</String>
		<String _locID="38891">I will send a steady supply of food to you.</String>
		<String _locID="38892">Expect food to continue arriving from me.</String>
		<String _locID="38893">You need food to keep fighting, so I will keep sending it.</String>
		<String _locID="38894">Here is some wood. Expect continual shipments of more from me.</String>
		<String _locID="38895">My troops are on their way.</String>
		<String _locID="38896">Do not mistake my recent lack of correspondence as a lack of resolve to decimate our opponent!</String>
		<String _locID="38897">Please tribute me coin for an immediate need I have.</String>
		<String _locID="38898">Request that you tribute me food.</String>
		<String _locID="38899">I have a request that you tribute me wood.</String>
		<String _locID="38900">Your contribution to that assault was bold, and greatly appreciated.</String>
		<String _locID="38901">Thank you for the coin.</String>
		<String _locID="38902">I thank you for your tribute of food.</String>
		<String _locID="38903">My base may have been badly damaged if you had not come to my defense.</String>
		<String _locID="38904">The resources you tributed to my empire are greatly appreciated.</String>
		<String _locID="38905">The wood you sent me will be well used, thank you.</String>
		<String _locID="38906">What a mighty foe the British have proven to be.</String>
		<String _locID="38907">The Dutch are overpowering us.</String>
		<String _locID="38908">The might of the French cannot be denied here.</String>
		<String _locID="38909">Whatever the Ottomans are doing, they are doing it well enough to hand us our hats.</String>
		<String _locID="38910">I do not know if we will be able to stand up to the Ottoman advance.</String>
		<String _locID="38911">The Portuguese have proven powerful adversaries. Things are looking dark for us.</String>
		<String _locID="38912">The Russians have been powerful foes in this battle. I fear perhaps too powerful.</String>
		<String _locID="38913">What have the Spanish done to become so mighty? I doubt we will be able to stop them.</String>
		<String _locID="38914">Consider this: we are losing, but among our opponents, the weakest is the British.</String>
		<String _locID="38915">I perceive we may lose if we don't counter-attack soon. I suggest the Dutch, who are clearly weaker.</String>
		<String _locID="38916">Although we fade, we must strike at their weakness, the French.</String>
		<String _locID="38917">As I am not leading them, our weakest foe is German. I suggest we strike at them before we are defeated ourselves.</String>
		<String _locID="38918">The war is going in their favor. Shall we strike their weakness, the Portuguese?</String>
		<String _locID="38919">If we don't attack the Russians soon we may be defeated.</String>
		<String _locID="38920">I will not yield defeat willingly, but if we do not attack the Spanish soon I may be forced to.</String>
		<String _locID="38921">You are a superb strategician. In this rare case, perhaps even better than I.</String>
		<String _locID="38922">I regret not having shared more of my superior capabilities with you during this battle. If I had, we might not be losing.</String>
		<String _locID="38923">Continue to thrust forward! Great guns are the most respectable argument of the rights of kings.</String>
		<String _locID="38924">Your great army and my superior intellect shall together vanquish our foes.</String>
		<String _locID="38925">As an ally you have been useful in my conquering of the enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="38926">Things are not looking good for us, I fear.</String>
		<String _locID="38927">It does not take a military genius to see we've lost.</String>
		<String _locID="38928">There is no point in continuing this conflict; we have lost!</String>
		<String _locID="38929">Quickly, choose a trading post to attack and we will strike it together!</String>
		<String _locID="38930">The enemy has allied with some natives. A laughable plan at best.</String>
		<String _locID="38931">The enemy has overextended his position by claiming a trade site too early.</String>
		<String _locID="38932">The enemy has more native allies than we do. We should move to change that.</String>
		<String _locID="38933">Our foe seeks trade strength. Our military strength has a reply for that.</String>
		<String _locID="38934">Your alliance with the natives in this New World was bold. I like that.</String>
		<String _locID="38935">The trade route you are exploiting should serve us well, both in battle and after we claim victory!</String>
		<String _locID="38936">Impressive. You understand that even small advances can help in our quest for victory.</String>
		<String _locID="38937">A first small step toward triumph.</String>
		<String _locID="38938">You are wise to add to your supplies any way you can.</String>
		<String _locID="38939">Another small boost to your coffers.</String>
		<String _locID="38940">Soldiers cannot eat their boots. At least not usually.</String>
		<String _locID="38941">Although you have collected more treasures than I have, my base has expanded boldly.</String>
		<String _locID="38942">You have proven yourself a collector. Hopefully next, a warrior.</String>
		<String _locID="38943">Where is the gain to our alliance, your collecting treasures so close to my town?</String>
		<String _locID="38944">The treasures near my base should be left for my explorer.</String>
		<String _locID="38945">The native warriors you have befriended will give us an edge.</String>
		<String _locID="38946">Each settler you have working for you is an advantage our foes will rue.</String>
		<String _locID="38947">More wood for you means less wood for them.</String>
		<String _locID="38948">Excellent move. We now have more native allies than our foe.</String>
		<String _locID="38949">We move that much closer to controlling all trade in this area.</String>
		<String _locID="38950">Be certain you incorporate your walls into an overall strategy of offense.</String>
		<String _locID="38951">You will note I have allied with a native village in the New World. Another brilliant maneuver.</String>
		<String _locID="38952">My decisive action in claiming a trade site will help us achieve victory.</String>
		<String _locID="38953">A treasure has been claimed and secured by me.</String>
		<String _locID="38954">The New World has yielded coin for my coffers.</String>
		<String _locID="38955">It may not be sauerkraut, but it will help fill my soldier's bellies.</String>
		<String _locID="38956">As the superior strategician, you'll appreciate that any treasure I gain helps us both.</String>
		<String _locID="38957">You are not exploiting the advantages of the New World effectively; gather more treasures.</String>
		<String _locID="38958">Native warriors are welcome additions to my army.</String>
		<String _locID="38959">Another settler has elected to serve under the German flag.</String>
		<String _locID="38960">I can use wood. Even wood will have a small role to play in our eventual win.</String>
		<String _locID="38961">Thanks to my efforts, we have another native ally.</String>
		<String _locID="38962">I have claimed a trading site. I encourage you to increase your own contribution to our alliance.</String>
		<String _locID="38963">I am constructing walls to shelter my economy while my military expands.</String>
		<String _locID="38964">Our bold strategy may yet pay off; we now hold four of a kind.</String>
		<String _locID="38965">Do not let your reduced rating discourage you. After all, a crown is merely a hat that lets the rain in.</String>
		<String _locID="38966">Your increased rating indicates you are one to let your actions speak for you.</String>
		<String _locID="38967">At the rate you are gaining experience, the day may come in which I ask you for military advice myself.</String>
		<String _locID="38968">I admire opposition that has conviction, but in less than one minute I will be the one convinced.</String>
		<String _locID="38969">I observe that in one minute I will lose this battle. You have my respect.</String>
		<String _locID="38970">It will all be over very soon, and I am forced to admit your superiority in this battle.</String>
		<String _locID="38971">Every warrior must accept defeat eventually, at least every warrior I meet.</String>
		<String _locID="38972">You should deem it an honor to have been defeated by me.</String>
		<String _locID="38973">In one minute your cause will be utterly defeated.</String>
		<String _locID="38974">Several opponents engage at once here, but my soldiers are doubtlessly the best trained.</String>
		<String _locID="38975">There are soldiers from several armies fighting here. Another glorious fray.</String>
		<String _locID="38976">I'll begin by taking. Scholars later shall demonstrate my perfect right to have done so.</String>
		<String _locID="38977">As we face off before battle, I can only say I am grateful I am not you.</String>
		<String _locID="38978">I am called Frederick the Great. Can there be any question as to the outcome of this battle?</String>
		<String _locID="38979">The battle has only just engaged but already your only reasonable options are retreat or surrender.</String>
		<String _locID="38980">My forces are dominant and my strategy superior; how can you defeat me?</String>
		<String _locID="38981">Great guns, and the timely arrival of an ally, are the most respectable arguments of the rights of kings.</String>
		<String _locID="38982">The battle is turning in my favor.</String>
		<String _locID="38983">My ally has arrived! Together we shall decimate your forces.</String>
		<String _locID="38984">Beware, my foe! My battalions are strengthened by my ally!</String>
		<String _locID="38985">Your ally saved you in this battle.</String>
		<String _locID="38986">I curse your luck. If not for your ally's arrival I would have smashed your army in this battle!</String>
		<String _locID="38987">This battle is slipping from my grasp!</String>
		<String _locID="38988">It is only because your ally has arrived in time with reinforcements that you are winning this fight.</String>
		<String _locID="38989">Your skill in advancing is plain. How you will use that to your advantage is not, likely not even to you.</String>
		<String _locID="38990">I see you have advanced to the next Age. It's a pity you can't advance your military talents as easily.</String>
		<String _locID="38991">You have squandered your resources advancing to the next Age so quickly, nothing more.</String>
		<String _locID="38992">It is not that your have beat me in reaching a higher Age, it is that I have displayed superior patience.</String>
		<String _locID="38993">Your decision to gain native allies was wise. How you will utilize them will no doubt be foolish.</String>
		<String _locID="38994">Losing that trading post was a setback, but no more.</String>
		<String _locID="38995">An effective commander utilizes all of the resources available to him. I assure you that that town center was only a small element of my arsenal.</String>
		<String _locID="38996">I suppose you think the loss of my town center will affect my military machine, but I assure you it will not.</String>
		<String _locID="38997">A town center may be the heart of a leader's base, but a wise commander... well, I suppose losing it stinks however I cut it.</String>
		<String _locID="38998">Curse it -- my town center was the only decent source of bratwurst in the whole New World!</String>
		<String _locID="38999">That town center was essential to the gestalt of my base.</String>
		<String _locID="39000">You fool; the finest biergarten and lager on this whole continent were inside that town center!</String>
		<String _locID="39001">Flattening my town center has filled me with angst.</String>
		<String _locID="39002">The destruction of that trading post has served only to focus my attention on wiping your empire from the New World.</String>
		<String _locID="39003">A kindergartener could have seen that attack coming.</String>
		<String _locID="39004">Do you think destroying that trade site will lead to your victory? You probably also claim to see poltergeists.</String>
		<String _locID="39005">You are like a lammergeier, a cowardly vulture attacking my trade sites when I am not prepared to defend them.</String>
		<String _locID="39006">Are you waiting until I arrive with the army of the apocalypse before advancing to the Commerce Age?</String>
		<String _locID="39007">Do you plan to advance to the Commerce Age after your kaffeeklatsch?</String>
		<String _locID="39008">Apparently Oktoberfest will come and go before you reach the Commerce Age.</String>
		<String _locID="39009">My schnauzer could dog paddle to the New World faster than you advance through the Ages.</String>
		<String _locID="39010">Your empire is advancing so slowly you might have more luck if you sent settlers to the front lines with rakes.</String>
		<String _locID="39011">You are taking so long to advance, perhaps you should just pack your whole town up in a wagon and send it back to the old world.</String>
		<String _locID="39012">It does not take an ubermensch to take an empire to the Commerce Age!</String>
		<String _locID="39013">Surely you do not expect that move alone to save you.</String>
		<String _locID="39014">Your quick advancement to the Commerce Age fills me with weltschmerz.</String>
		<String _locID="39015">If your strategy is to advance your empire as slowly as possible so as to weaken us with laughter, you are succeeding.</String>
		<String _locID="39016">Is your empire hitched to a slug?</String>
		<String _locID="39017">Your slow rise to the second Age indicates you have little wille zur macht.</String>
		<String _locID="39018">I see you have finally joined the rest of us in the Commerce Age.</String>
		<String _locID="39019">You are rather separated from your allies. Perhaps you better begin shouting for help now.</String>
		<String _locID="39020">Do you expect the poor placement of your town center to allow you more time to practice your harpsichord?</String>
		<String _locID="39021">It is helpful that your towns are closely packed. We will raze them all as one.</String>
		<String _locID="39022">Your towns are huddled together like frightened rabbits in a pen.</String>
		<String _locID="39023">I have destroyed a trading post and ended your attempt at an unusual victory.</String>
		<String _locID="39024">I enjoyed destroying that trading post even more than usual.</String>
		<String _locID="39025">That stops your rather pathetic effort to snatch victory from the approaching jaws of defeat.</String>
		<String _locID="39026">That trading post should not have been built on my continent anyway.</String>
		<String _locID="39027">Believe me, the natives will be much happier allying with my empire than yours.</String>
		<String _locID="39028">I hope you weren't going to use that town center.</String>
		<String _locID="39029">Don't feel too bad. Where your town center stood I plan to construct a nice strudel stand.</String>
		<String _locID="39030">Your town center put up as mighty a fight as a she-dachshund.</String>
		<String _locID="39031">I have crushed your town center just as I planned.</String>
		<String _locID="39032">Your town center has fallen and the rest of your base will soon follow it.</String>
		<String _locID="39033">With your town center destroyed I imagine you now feel a great wanderlust.</String>
		<String _locID="39034">I'm sorry I destroyed your town center. Well, no, not really.</String>
		<String _locID="39035">Perhaps you can build another town center. I could use some more practice destroying them.</String>
		<String _locID="39036">I removed the trading post you had carelessly built on my trading route.</String>
		<String _locID="39037">That trading post was obstructing my plans to conquer the New World.</String>
		<String _locID="39038">You didn't really need that trading post.</String>
		<String _locID="39039">Why did you build a trading post in the middle of my empire anyway?</String>
		<String _locID="39040">I tire of inept opposition. Bring your best or just have your resignation delivered now.</String>
		<String _locID="39041">Greetings. Prepare to be destroyed.</String>
		<String _locID="39042">I am Frederick the Great. I cannot imagine why you dare to challenge me.</String>
		<String _locID="39043">This New World looks like it will make a good new Germany, don't you think?</String>
		<String _locID="39044">I can only hope you will not collapse before my assault as easily as my last foe.</String>
		<String _locID="39045">Note to my opponent: this land belongs to me.</String>
		<String _locID="39046">Welcome to the New World. My New World.</String>
		<String _locID="39047">I am not interested in fighting. Only in winning.</String>
		<String _locID="39048">I toyed with war in the prior conflict. Now I will bring my full powers to bear.</String>
		<String _locID="39049">I am glad to see you expect a greater challenge this time. I assure you I will bring one.</String>
		<String _locID="39050">It is good that you seek a great challenge. I have yet to find even a mild one.</String>
		<String _locID="39051">I grasp that you want more of a challenge. Too bad you will not also be grasping victory.</String>
		<String _locID="39052">I will give my brilliance a vacation. You will face only ordinary genius this time.</String>
		<String _locID="39053">I see you seek a less overwhelming match. I hope you won't mind if I eat some bratwurst while we do battle.</String>
		<String _locID="39054">I cannot fault you for seeking to reduce the challenge, considering your opponent is me.</String>
		<String _locID="39055">This battle should be a little easier to deal with. I'll tie one army behind my back.</String>
		<String _locID="39056">We do battle in the same region of the New World as our prior conflict.</String>
		<String _locID="39057">The odds are less stacked against you this time. I'll try not to punish you too severely.</String>
		<String _locID="39058">Although the odds are stacked in my favor do not expect mercy from Frederick the Great.</String>
		<String _locID="39059">I am surprised you think you can defend against both me and an ally. I look forward to proving you very wrong.</String>
		<String _locID="39060">These odds are more like it. I'm going to enjoy paving over your town with my empire.</String>
		<String _locID="39061">These odds seem a bit extreme in my favor. No matter, I will show you again how war is fought.</String>
		<String _locID="39062">Odds are stacked against you. If this is the way you prefer to be destroyed, fine by me.</String>
		<String _locID="39063">You were careless. I rescued my explorer out from beneath your nose.</String>
		<String _locID="39064">My explorer has been rescued and tells me you are ripe to conquer.</String>
		<String _locID="39065">Your explorer has been spotted by my forces. Why don't you just hide him behind your town center.</String>
		<String _locID="39066">There is your first army. It is more pathetic than I expected.</String>
		<String _locID="39067">It doesn't surprise me that your soldiers appear to be lost.</String>
		<String _locID="39068">You may wish to round up your small wandering army before I do it for you.</String>
		<String _locID="39069">I see that squad of soldiers scouting for my base. I will write off a snippy letter to Voltaire if you persist.</String>
		<String _locID="39070">Take it from a true military genius: you should have brought a real army.</String>
		<String _locID="39071">Are your soldiers wandering near my town center because they like bratwurst? I can't imagine any other reason they would.</String>
		<String _locID="39072">Although I understand your wanting to avoid my soldiers, you embarrass yourself attacking my civilians.</String>
		<String _locID="39073">Stop attacking my settlers.</String>
		<String _locID="39074">Don't make my settlers mad. You won't like them when they're mad.</String>
		<String _locID="39075">Somehow you've managed to mistake my settlers for my army. Kindly back off until my actual soldiers arrive.</String>
		<String _locID="39076">This large army of yours appears confused and leaderless. No, correction, I see it is being commanded by you.</String>
		<String _locID="39077">That's a large army you have assembled. Poorly trained and badly equipped no doubt, but large.</String>
		<String _locID="39078">I advise moving the large army walking through my empire to the nearest rubbish heap, where they will feel more at home.</String>
		<String _locID="39079">Is that an army entering my area? I'm surprised you could convince that many soldiers to fight under your banner.</String>
		<String _locID="39080">I see you have sent a group of targets for my troops.</String>
		<String _locID="39081">What do you plan to do with that band of ruffians you call soldiers? Gather truffles?</String>
		<String _locID="39082">You were cruel to send those soldiers marching off to their doom.</String>
		<String _locID="39083">Why do you have a cluster of soldiers wandering around in the middle of nowhere?</String>
		<String _locID="39084">I suppose you might call that pathetic group of soldiers an army, but I wouldn't.</String>
		<String _locID="39085">Have you sent those soldiers into the wilderness to punish them?</String>
		<String _locID="39086">How did you assemble such a potent force?</String>
		<String _locID="39087">Your army is worthy of... well, me. Not good.</String>
		<String _locID="39088">Your army has lost its way. It should be back in your town, defending it.</String>
		<String _locID="39089">If I were facing true military skill I might actually be worried at this point.</String>
		<String _locID="39090">You may want to recover the small group of deserters fleeing through my empire. Oh, I'm sorry, was that your army?</String>
		<String _locID="39091">I can only imagine those soldiers you have sent into the wilderness are trying to find their way home.</String>
		<String _locID="39092">Why do you have a tiny army doing nothing in the middle of nowhere? Do you call that a strategy?</String>
		<String _locID="39093">You appear to have some soldiers lost in my empire. Remove them before I am forced to.</String>
		<String _locID="39094">It is always a joy to discover my opponent's base. The anticipation of razing it comes more clearly into focus.</String>
		<String _locID="39095">I see your town center. You may want to take one last look at it yourself.</String>
		<String _locID="39096">I've spotted your town center. It will make a lovely crater.</String>
		<String _locID="39097">Is that your town center I see? Nice of you to place it directly in the path of my conquering army.</String>
		<String _locID="39098">You wasted your ammunition. Everything in the New World belongs to me.</String>
		<String _locID="39099">That small fight is but a microcosm of the great battles, and results, to come.</String>
		<String _locID="39100">I am not surprised I took that treasure, but I am surprised you thought you might beat me to it.</String>
		<String _locID="39101">Another treasure for me, another beating for you.</String>
		<String _locID="39102">Would you like three guesses as to whose army is here? Ah, but you'll be too busy dying to play games.</String>
		<String _locID="39103">You will be overjoyed to hear that my exceptionally well trained German army has arrived to fight you.</String>
		<String _locID="39104">I look forward to this battle, but my soldiers hunger for it.</String>
		<String _locID="39105">My troops have arrived. I pity yours.</String>
		<String _locID="39106">I have not heard from you in awhile. I can only imagine you are spending your time knitting caps.</String>
		<String _locID="39107">Are you waiting to attack, or are you just contemplating surrender?</String>
		<String _locID="39108">It has been so long since I've seen any activity from you I imagine you may have forgotten we are at war. My army will be happy to remind you.</String>
		<String _locID="39109">Your empire is awfully quiet. Have your soldiers traded their weapons for hoes?</String>
		<String _locID="39110">Witness my mastery of the flute! Well, that, and my skills in warfare, of course.</String>
		<String _locID="39113">My empire has been defeated. I offer my surrender.</String>
		<String _locID="39114">It does not take a genius to recognize I am defeated. I request to resign.</String>
		<String _locID="39115">You may have stopped me on one front, but there are other ways to win.</String>
		<String _locID="39116">I see you have taken the lead in recruiting native allies. Victory will still be mine.</String>
		<String _locID="39117">Gaining one more trading post will not make a difference. You will still be defeated.</String>
		<String _locID="39118">You have taken the lead on collecting trade sites, but I assure you it will make no difference in the end.</String>
		<String _locID="39119">You have collected a New World treasure, but there is more to winning a war than that.</String>
		<String _locID="39120">Does finding goodies please you? Crushing empires pleases me.</String>
		<String _locID="39121">A few coins in your coffers will hardly improve your chances against my ravaging armies.</String>
		<String _locID="39122">Enjoy the food you just found. Soon enough all you'll have to eat is sauerkraut.</String>
		<String _locID="39123">Your focus is on collecting treasures. Mine is on building an unstoppable military empire.</String>
		<String _locID="39124">That treasure belonged to me. I'll recover the slight by razing your town.</String>
		<String _locID="39125">I feel sorry for any natives you have fooled into joining you.</String>
		<String _locID="39126">Why don't you just send your new settler back to the old world, where it's safe.</String>
		<String _locID="39127">That wood you just found could be used to build a nice raft. Maybe you could try to escape my New World on it.</String>
		<String _locID="39128">Ah, walls. Like the crunchy outer coating to a delightful German chocolate.</String>
		<String _locID="39129">Would it interest you to learn I have allied with natives of this New World? Perhaps not, you are still learning how to boil water.</String>
		<String _locID="39130">I have the first trading post. You, however, have... well, nothing significant at all.</String>
		<String _locID="39131">Another treasure on the New World is mine.</String>
		<String _locID="39132">One more treasure for me, one less for you. Fitting, really.</String>
		<String _locID="39133">A treasure has granted me more coin. As if I needed it.</String>
		<String _locID="39134">This food tastes good. You can be certain I won't be sharing it with you.</String>
		<String _locID="39135">Why did you leave a treasure unclaimed so near your town? It is mine now.</String>
		<String _locID="39136">Even I am slightly surprised that you have been so poor at collecting treasures.</String>
		<String _locID="39137">The natives are clearly more intelligent than you are; they are allying with me.</String>
		<String _locID="39138">Another settler has joined my empire. I am doing everything I can to reduce the time you suffer before you fall.</String>
		<String _locID="39139">More wood for me. I am gaining everything I need for a swift victory.</String>
		<String _locID="39140">While you gather alliances with natives, my empire prepares to build cannon.</String>
		<String _locID="39141">You may have found a foothold on the trading route, but will that really help you when my armies storm your empire?</String>
		<String _locID="39142">I admire your strategy. It won't bring you victory, but I admire it.</String>
		<String _locID="39143">I hope you remember how to get back to the Old World. The New World will soon belong to me.</String>
		<String _locID="39144">Your rating has dropped precipitously. Think of our next confrontation as a clinic.</String>
		<String _locID="39145">In this battle I will whip your hindquarters almost as hard as my father whipped mine, when I dared to write poetry!</String>
		<String _locID="39146">How did you increase your rating that much? I can only assume bribery.</String>
		<String _locID="39147">I see that your rating has increased a great deal since last we met. It will be all the more enjoyable to flatten you.</String>
		<String _locID="39148">Your rating is higher, but your choices in battle will no doubt be just as predictable as before.</String>
		<String _locID="39149">How nice that you have increased your rating. On my side, I look forward to increasing my victory count by one.</String>
		<String _locID="39150">You have gained much experience since we met last, but I doubt you'll be able to apply it toward a victory.</String>
		<String _locID="39151">I suppose you are proud to have earned some more experience since we last met. It is the last you'll ever get.</String>
		<String _locID="39152">You've collected a lot more experience since we met last. I hope you will apply it to providing me with some small challenge.</String>
		<String _locID="39153">Ah, I see your experience has increased. Too bad you cannot buy military ability with it.</String>
		<String _locID="39154">You go down with the ship. I will escape with the women and children.</String>
		<String _locID="39155">Which Mediterranean island will you retire to once these swine have been conquered?</String>
		<String _locID="39156">The new heavy artillery are miracles of modern science. You should give them a shot.</String>
		<String _locID="39157">For centuries cavalry have led the charges of battle... where did your horses run off to?</String>
		<String _locID="39158">Even the most degraded commoner knows wars cannot be won without infantry!</String>
		<String _locID="39159">It would be foolish to fight under these conditions.</String>
		<String _locID="39160">Let us save our strength for another fight.</String>
		<String _locID="39161">This will be a battle the poets will tell of for many years.</String>
		<String _locID="39162">My fears have been made whole. The heathen have bested us.</String>
		<String _locID="39165">They won! I am absolutely flabbergasted.</String>
		<String _locID="39166">Now that our foes have been eradicated we can move on to more important political matters.</String>
		<String _locID="39167">As I suspected, the enemy forces are broken.</String>
		<String _locID="39169">That was a close one!</String>
		<String _locID="39170">Our alliance will prove certain victory.</String>
		<String _locID="39171">My strategists predict a victory.</String>
		<String _locID="39172">Pretty sure I've got this one under control.</String>
		<String _locID="39173">Your reinforcements have arrived just in time.</String>
		<String _locID="39174">Look! Those heretical warmongers have recruited help from their allies.</String>
		<String _locID="39175">Good thinking.</String>
		<String _locID="39176">Alright.</String>
		<String _locID="39177">Excellent idea! Artillery is just what we need.</String>
		<String _locID="39178">Very good. Artillery with cavalry support will certainly pave the road to our victory.</String>
		<String _locID="39179">A wise choice. Artillery and infantry are the backbone of any successful army.</String>
		<String _locID="39180">Right. I will bolster our forces with cavalry.</String>
		<String _locID="39181">When the enemy hears my storm of thundering hooves and crashing cannonballs, they will surely flee for their lives.</String>
		<String _locID="39182">Yes I think that will work splendidly. Infantry and cavalry make a very strong combination.</String>
		<String _locID="39183">Well then, I shall flood the battlefields with legions of infantry.</String>
		<String _locID="39185">The enemy will surely be at our mercy of our crusading infantry and noble steeds.</String>
		<String _locID="39186">I regret to say my strained economy simply cannot bear such a burden.</String>
		<String _locID="39187">Unfortunately I have spent too much money on wine, women, and song to afford that.</String>
		<String _locID="39188">Regretfully, I must decline.</String>
		<String _locID="39189">I wish I could, but I cannot.</String>
		<String _locID="39190">My army is non-existent. There is nothing I can do.</String>
		<String _locID="39191">That is beyond God's will and simply impossible for me to do.</String>
		<String _locID="39192">Until I can recruit more troops, I'm afraid I cannot help.</String>
		<String _locID="39193">Those blasted dogs have destroyed our monopoly!</String>
		<String _locID="39194">It seems we have nearly forced the British back to their puny island.</String>
		<String _locID="39195">The Dutch are nearly defeated. Perhaps we should send them some sympathy tulips.</String>
		<String _locID="39196">I cannot say I am sad to see the French go.</String>
		<String _locID="39197">Our alliance has proved stronger than the German nation.</String>
		<String _locID="39199">It looks as if we have defeated the insurgent Portuguese rebellion.</String>
		<String _locID="39200">Superb. Our alliance has outlasted the Russian forces.</String>
		<String _locID="39201">The Spanish simply did not have the political foresight to last out this war.</String>
		<String _locID="39202">England is proving to be a formidable adversary.</String>
		<String _locID="39203">The Dutch are growing quite powerful, we must choose our actions carefully.</String>
		<String _locID="39204">The French frighten me with their mighty empire.</String>
		<String _locID="39205">The German Reich must be stopped before they become too dangerous.</String>
		<String _locID="39207">We have let the Portuguese dissenters build their empire unchecked. Now, I fear they will wage a ruthless civil war.</String>
		<String _locID="39208">My political connections inform me that we should be wary of the Russians.</String>
		<String _locID="39209">How could we have let the Spanish forces grow to such proportions?</String>
		<String _locID="39210">Your nation's scientific progress is outstanding! I can only hope my nation will follow in your footsteps.</String>
		<String _locID="39211">Very very impressive. I should be advancing shortly.</String>
		<String _locID="39212">The natives are restless... and what is worse, they are allied with the enemy!</String>
		<String _locID="39213">This could be bad. The enemy has recruited the natives for aid.</String>
		<String _locID="39214">You doing OK there chief?</String>
		<String _locID="39215">Scientific progress is a glorious thing, perhaps you should consider aging up.</String>
		<String _locID="39216">I would feel much more secure about our alliance if you were aging up a bit faster.</String>
		<String _locID="39217">Excellent work my friend. Now we must recruit an army.</String>
		<String _locID="39218">You're off to a great start. Keep at it.</String>
		<String _locID="39219">Savoring the flavor of the Age would be dandy if we didn't have a war on our hands!</String>
		<String _locID="39220">Glad to see you made it to the Commerce Age.</String>
		<String _locID="39221">Thank you for rescuing my explorer.</String>
		<String _locID="39222">My explorer is thankful. Let me know if I can return the favor.</String>
		<String _locID="39223">Nice to see you've rescued my explorer. I'll put him back to exploring immediately.</String>
		<String _locID="39224">Rejoice. The monopoly has been broken.</String>
		<String _locID="39225">I have shown the natives the error of their ways. They will no longer help the enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="39226">I have freed the natives from the bondage of our enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="39227">I'm pleased to inform you that I have sacked one of the enemies towns.</String>
		<String _locID="39228">See the ashes floating up? That is all that remains of an enemy town.</String>
		<String _locID="39229">Count this as an economic victory for us.</String>
		<String _locID="39230">The enemy's trade route fell easily under my sword.</String>
		<String _locID="39231">Damnation! The natives must be using black magic. My attack has failed.</String>
		<String _locID="39232">Their forces were too much. Hopefully the next attack will swing in our favor.</String>
		<String _locID="39233">No doubt my attack failed because my troops bartered their guns at the trading post.</String>
		<String _locID="39234">My explorer is slain!</String>
		<String _locID="39235">No! I have lost my explorer.</String>
		<String _locID="39236">Cougars and bison and bears, oh my.</String>
		<String _locID="39237">My explorer has been eaten by the wilderness.</String>
		<String _locID="39238">I have lost my troops, my economy, and my will to fight. I'm afraid I must be resigning soon.</String>
		<String _locID="39239">We put up a good fight, but it looks as if we should be resigning soon. Don't you think?</String>
		<String _locID="39240">I could use some help here.</String>
		<String _locID="39241">Send what you can to help fight please.</String>
		<String _locID="39242">To arms, to arms! My base is under siege.</String>
		<String _locID="39243">They have me surrounded. I will do what I can, but I am greatly in need of your troops.</String>
		<String _locID="39244">Things are looking pretty grim over here. If you don't send some aid soon, I'm done for.</String>
		<String _locID="39245">Pleased to make your alliance.</String>
		<String _locID="39246">I am sure we'll make an excellent team.</String>
		<String _locID="39247">This will be a challenge, I hope we prevail.</String>
		<String _locID="39248">This may not be as challenging as before. Surely we will be victorious.</String>
		<String _locID="39249">Last time we faced each other, you proved your merit in battle. I am glad to see we're allies this time.</String>
		<String _locID="39250">It seems we are allies again. This time I shall strive to pull my weight.</String>
		<String _locID="39251">I hope you prove to be a better ally than opponent.</String>
		<String _locID="39252">Not you again!</String>
		<String _locID="39253">This terrain looks mighty familiar, no?</String>
		<String _locID="39254">Last time we were disgraced in battle. Lets see to it we are the victors this time around.</String>
		<String _locID="39255">Ugh! My head still hurts from celebrating our last victory!</String>
		<String _locID="39256">The good news is I have my explorer back. The bad news is they charged me a hefty ransom.</String>
		<String _locID="39257">Huzzah! I have rescued my explorer.</String>
		<String _locID="39258">The enemy's troops must be drinking at the tavern. Now is the time to strike their main base.</String>
		<String _locID="39259">The enemy has no barracks. If you were to send in some cavalry they couldn't even muster a single pikeman.</String>
		<String _locID="39260">Look what I've found: a stableless town. Artillery would be perfect right now.</String>
		<String _locID="39261">Don't spend this all on ale.</String>
		<String _locID="39262">Put this money to good use.</String>
		<String _locID="39263">Eat to live, and not live to eat.</String>
		<String _locID="39264">Your settlers look mighty thin, perhaps they could use some food.</String>
		<String _locID="39265">Use this timber to your advantage.</String>
		<String _locID="39266">This lumber should help strengthen your town's infrastructure.</String>
		<String _locID="39267">I shall send my soldiers to the enemy front.</String>
		<String _locID="39268">I am going to attack the enemy base now.</String>
		<String _locID="39269">If the enemy has any unprotected gatherers I will hunt them down.</String>
		<String _locID="39270">As we speak my troops are readying themselves to strike at the heart of the enemy's base.</String>
		<String _locID="39271">My troops are preparing to ravage the enemy's main base.</String>
		<String _locID="39272">I will take care of these pesky natives.</String>
		<String _locID="39273">I will deprive the enemy of his liquor by destroying this trade site.</String>
		<String _locID="39274">I am coming to your aid.</String>
		<String _locID="39275">My troops are on the way!</String>
		<String _locID="39276">I will be right there.</String>
		<String _locID="39277">I'm going to set up military operations in this area.</String>
		<String _locID="39278">This will be the site of my next town. I think I shall christen it with your name.</String>
		<String _locID="39279">I have decided to build my next town center approximately right here.</String>
		<String _locID="39280">For only a few beads these natives will gladly aid us in our war.</String>
		<String _locID="39281">I've decided it's time to get the locals involved in our fight.</String>
		<String _locID="39282">A trade post here will ensure plenty of wine to give our soldiers spirit.</String>
		<String _locID="39283">Just to let you know, I'll be building a trading post here.</String>
		<String _locID="39284">On my mother's honor, this building shall not fall.</String>
		<String _locID="39285">This location is essential to our success. I shall defend it.</String>
		<String _locID="39286">The enemy is trying to oppress our natives, they must be protected!</String>
		<String _locID="39287">We shall make a stand in this town.</String>
		<String _locID="39288">They are trying to take our source of imported wine! We must defend this trading post.</String>
		<String _locID="39289">My coffers are overflowing with wealth. I happily share it with you.</String>
		<String _locID="39290">Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Give a man a boatload of fish and he will eat for a damn long time.</String>
		<String _locID="39291">Shiver me timbers, I will give you more wood.</String>
		<String _locID="39292">Keep up the fighting, I'm on my way.</String>
		<String _locID="39293">My forces are en route.</String>
		<String _locID="39294">Hold the line, reinforcements are on the way.</String>
		<String _locID="39295">So... drink any good ale lately?</String>
		<String _locID="39296">You must be one of the strong silent types.</String>
		<String _locID="39297">Checking your email?</String>
		<String _locID="39298">Alms for the poor? My friend, I am in need of some coin.</String>
		<String _locID="39299">Could you spare a few coins for a loyal ally?</String>
		<String _locID="39300">There are starving children in my land. Can you provide some food?</String>
		<String _locID="39301">My soldiers have been reduced to eating their shoes. Do you have any food you could send my way?</String>
		<String _locID="39302">My lumberjacks have gone on strike. Would you give me wood?</String>
		<String _locID="39303">If you could spare some wood I would be a very happy ally.</String>
		<String _locID="39304">Your reinforcements surely turned the tide of battle, many thanks. Now we can continue forward.</String>
		<String _locID="39305">Your troops have saved the day. Our offensive movement presses on.</String>
		<String _locID="39306">An offensive victory all thanks to your soldiers.</String>
		<String _locID="39307">Thanks for the coin. I'm off to the tavern now.</String>
		<String _locID="39308">The children shall eat, thanks to your generosity.</String>
		<String _locID="39309">My base still stands because of your help. I will erect a statue here in your honor.</String>
		<String _locID="39310">Thank you for helping fend off the invaders.</String>
		<String _locID="39311">Many thanks are in order for your reinforcements at my base.</String>
		<String _locID="39312">Your tribute is greatly appreciated.</String>
		<String _locID="39313">Ah, so much wood to build new buildings with! Thank you my friend.</String>
		<String _locID="39314">We are crumbling under the might of the British empire.</String>
		<String _locID="39315">The Dutch will be our undoing.</String>
		<String _locID="39316">It seems the French forces will overtake us soon.</String>
		<String _locID="39319">I fear we shall fall to the rebel Portuguese forces.</String>
		<String _locID="39320">It looks as if our towns will be waving  Russian flags soon.</String>
		<String _locID="39321">The Spanish conquistadors have won the day.</String>
		<String _locID="39322">Perhaps if we attack the British we can turn this war around.</String>
		<String _locID="39323">Their alliance is proving to be stronger than expected, however my spies inform me the Dutch are the weakest. Let us strike them!</String>
		<String _locID="39324">We may have lost the war, but I believe we can still win a battle versus the French.</String>
		<String _locID="39325">Let us take down the Germans before our empire falls.</String>
		<String _locID="39326">The Germans can at least be taken out of this fight by immediate action on our part.</String>
		<String _locID="39327">It may prove impossible for us to defeat the enemy entirely, but I believe we can crush the rebel Portuguese forces.</String>
		<String _locID="39328">Our future is dim my friend, but not all is lost. Russia is vulnerable to attack.</String>
		<String _locID="39329">This war has not been favorable for us. Maybe if we hit the Spanish we can turn things around.</String>
		<String _locID="39330">It seems my long hours at the taverns have caused our defeat.</String>
		<String _locID="39331">Wish I could have been more helpful. My apologies.</String>
		<String _locID="39332">This is all your fault!</String>
		<String _locID="39333">Alas. This will always be remembered as the war you lost for us.</String>
		<String _locID="39334">The war seems to be going well. Keep up the good work.</String>
		<String _locID="39335">Good fortune smiles upon us. The war is in our favor.</String>
		<String _locID="39336">Your bravery has shone in battle, I am indebted to your strength.</String>
		<String _locID="39337">Because of you, we may indeed be victorious.</String>
		<String _locID="39338">Ha! We have the upper hand, despite your blunderings. Go make me a sandwich.</String>
		<String _locID="39339">While I'm off winning the campaign you're off looking at all the pretty graphics.</String>
		<String _locID="39340">Let us make the best of this and resign before we are utterly destroyed.</String>
		<String _locID="39341">Well, there is nothing left we can do to win. Let us resign and be done with it.</String>
		<String _locID="39342">Look on the bright side, they may die of the plague.</String>
		<String _locID="39343">The enemy has reached a monopoly. Let us make plans to destroy it as soon as possible.</String>
		<String _locID="39344">Figures. The enemy is recruiting the locals to help them.</String>
		<String _locID="39345">It looks as if the enemy is trying to get a leg up on us economically.</String>
		<String _locID="39346">The enemy has more native sites than us now. Argh.</String>
		<String _locID="39347">Be warned, the enemy is trying to outdo us economically. Look, they have more trade sites than us now.</String>
		<String _locID="39349">Hooray! We have the first trade site.</String>
		<String _locID="39350">Well done. I can see I have made a wise alliance.</String>
		<String _locID="39351">Quite the skills you got there.</String>
		<String _locID="39352">The first treasure, surely an omen of good fortune.</String>
		<String _locID="39353">Excellent. You truly are the master of getting booty.</String>
		<String _locID="39354">Good work on collecting treasures, my friend.</String>
		<String _locID="39355">Nothing like a full treasure chest, eh?</String>
		<String _locID="39356">You shall eat well tonight, my friend.</String>
		<String _locID="39357">Your plundering skills are amazing. Do you happen to have a treasure map by chance?</String>
		<String _locID="39358">You should at least say thank you for that one.</String>
		<String _locID="39359">Natives to the rescue!</String>
		<String _locID="39360">Good work, a gainful boon to your economy.</String>
		<String _locID="39361">A bundle of extra wood should definitely come in handy.</String>
		<String _locID="39362">Thanks to you we now hold more native sites.</String>
		<String _locID="39363">Good work. We now control more trade sites than they do.</String>
		<String _locID="39364">Perhaps those resources would be better spent on troops?</String>
		<String _locID="39365">Playing defensive are we? Well then I expect you to come wall around my base too.</String>
		<String _locID="39366">I have struck a deal with the natives. They now fight for us.</String>
		<String _locID="39367">I am now the proud owner of the first trading post.</String>
		<String _locID="39368">Behold! What wondrous treasures this New World contains.</String>
		<String _locID="39369">More treasure for us now, and less treasure for our enemies to pick up later.</String>
		<String _locID="39370">Marvelous, what a find!</String>
		<String _locID="39371">There is nothing like the sound of coins filling my coffers.</String>
		<String _locID="39372">My my, a feast for kings I just discovered.</String>
		<String _locID="39373">I found this treasure lying around your base. Don't worry though, I will repay the favor soon enough.</String>
		<String _locID="39374">I love exploring and discovering treasure, but it is important you do so as well.</String>
		<String _locID="39375">I hope you're not expecting me to collect all the treasure.</String>
		<String _locID="39376">Great! We now have native warriors among our ranks.</String>
		<String _locID="39377">The more settlers I rescue, the more resources I'll have to contribute to our effort.</String>
		<String _locID="39378">I found some wood to boost the construction of future buildings.</String>
		<String _locID="39379">I have convinced more natives to help us in our cause.</String>
		<String _locID="39380">I have constructed another trade site for us. This will directly contribute to our resource funds.</String>
		<String _locID="39381">By building walls around my base I hope to keep the enemy out. Your forces, of course, are welcome inside.</String>
		<String _locID="39382">These sturdy walls should serve as an excellent fallback point in the event we need it.</String>
		<String _locID="39383">Our efforts have paid off, we now control a monopoly. Now let us defend it!</String>
		<String _locID="39384">Welcome back to the battlefield, sir. I trust your time away was productive.</String>
		<String _locID="39385">Nice to see you again. I can tell your skills as a leader have grown.</String>
		<String _locID="39386">Great to have you back. I have heard tales of your conquests around the globe.</String>
		<String _locID="39387">Unfortunately their monopoly will be our downfall.</String>
		<String _locID="39388">Congratulations. Our monopoly has surely been the cause of our triumph.</String>
		<String _locID="39389">This shall be a battle for the history books... and I shall be recorded as the victor.</String>
		<String _locID="39390">Shall I go ahead and declare myself the victor now or are you actually going to fight?</String>
		<String _locID="39391">You realize you stand no chance of winning?</String>
		<String _locID="39392">Any last requests before I rip your army asunder?</String>
		<String _locID="39393">I bet you wish your allies were as helpful as mine.</String>
		<String _locID="39394">I had you if not for your ally's support... I had you!</String>
		<String _locID="39395">Your speed is impressive, but your strength may be lacking.</String>
		<String _locID="39396">Fancy technology will mean little when my army plunders your town.</String>
		<String _locID="39397">Trying to oppress the locals will not win you the war.</String>
		<String _locID="39398">Destroying the local culture is reprehensible, why don't you strike at me instead?</String>
		<String _locID="39399">You have razed my town center, you filthy swine!</String>
		<String _locID="39400">Cutting off my trade routes will not save you from the wrath of my army.</String>
		<String _locID="39401">Technological advancements are marvelous things. You should try them sometime.</String>
		<String _locID="39402">I feel so sorry for your poor technological advancements I'm almost tempted to send you some resources. Heh, almost.</String>
		<String _locID="39403">I will tell them to put 'First to reach Commerce Age' on your tombstone.</String>
		<String _locID="39404">How is it the saying goes? Last to Commerce Age, first to die?</String>
		<String _locID="39405">Your town is so far from your allies. They won't be able to hear your screams as your town is being burned to cinders.</String>
		<String _locID="39406">Cowards of a feather flock together. I suppose that's why you and your ally built next to each other.</String>
		<String _locID="39407">Nice try. Try again.</String>
		<String _locID="39408">Ha ha. I have freed the natives from your oppression.</String>
		<String _locID="39409">I shall keep the rubble from your town as a souvenir of my conquests.</String>
		<String _locID="39410">I have destroyed your trading post. What are you going to do?</String>
		<String _locID="39411">It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. Of course it will be even more of a pleasure to destroy you.</String>
		<String _locID="39412">How is it again they say "Prepare to die" in your native tongue?</String>
		<String _locID="39413">Always a pleasure to meet new opponents to conquer.</String>
		<String _locID="39414">It's always nice to challenge ourselves isn't it?</String>
		<String _locID="39415">Perhaps you can defeat me if I don't try as hard.</String>
		<String _locID="39416">This all seems so familiar to me.</String>
		<String _locID="39417">Perhaps you stand a greater chance of winning now that you have strategically reduced your enemies.</String>
		<String _locID="39418">You are arrogant to assume you can conquer me with my new alliances.</String>
		<String _locID="39419">Behold. My explorer walks again.</String>
		<String _locID="39420">You should not be so obvious. I have discovered your explorer.</String>
		<String _locID="39421">Your explorer isn't the stealthiest character is he?</String>
		<String _locID="39422">If your army is in need of guidance you can gladly send them to fight for me.</String>
		<String _locID="39423">Are you going to attack me or were you just out for a stroll?</String>
		<String _locID="39424">Sending your soldiers into the jaws of the beast... you are either very brave or very very foolish.</String>
		<String _locID="39425">Did I give you permission to kill my villagers? Prepare to die.</String>
		<String _locID="39426">Killing my defenseless settlers I see... do not think I'll have mercy on your women and children now!</String>
		<String _locID="39427">Your army is huge. I'm afraid of the number of graves I'll have to dig for them.</String>
		<String _locID="39428">Your ragtag band of brigands do not scare me!</String>
		<String _locID="39429">All right. We'll call it a draw.</String>
		<String _locID="39430">You call that an army?</String>
		<String _locID="39431">I see your town. It will look beautiful once my banner is flying over it.</String>
		<String _locID="39432">Aha! I have found your town center. You might as well resign now.</String>
		<String _locID="39433">It was a pleasure doing business with you.</String>
		<String _locID="39434">Let the onslaught begin!</String>
		<String _locID="39435">Have no mercy and offer no quarter! Attack! Attack!</String>
		<String _locID="39436">Charge! Cut them down and let them drown in their own blood! Charge!</String>
		<String _locID="39437">I have not seen any activity from you in a while. Clearly you have taken up gardening.</String>
		<String _locID="39438">Why don't you use this downtime to go fetch me some wine.</String>
		<String _locID="39439">Ho hum. You are turning out to be quite the boring adversary.</String>
		<String _locID="39441">Clearly I underestimated you. So I must resign.</String>
		<String _locID="39442">Somehow you outwitted me. Now I am forced to surrender.</String>
		<String _locID="39443">Good. I was hoping you would offer a challenge at some point.</String>
		<String _locID="39444">Capitalizing on what I started, I see.</String>
		<String _locID="39445">While you are busy constructing more trade sites, I make plans for your demise.</String>
		<String _locID="39446">Congratulations you have found the first treasure! You can resign now.</String>
		<String _locID="39447">You were the first to find some treasure, and you will be the first to die. Coincidence? I think not.</String>
		<String _locID="39448">Hand that over, by order of the Portuguese royal empire.</String>
		<String _locID="39449">Enjoy your plunder while you can.</String>
		<String _locID="39450">Just imagine, they'll print my face on your coins soon enough.</String>
		<String _locID="39451">Glad to see you have found some food. You were looking awfully frail.</String>
		<String _locID="39452">You have captured much treasure so far. Hmm, well I guess we all have our talents.</String>
		<String _locID="39453">You took my treasure you rabid dog you.</String>
		<String _locID="39454">Why must you bring more innocents to die for your cause?</String>
		<String _locID="39455">I suppose you'll need some way of replacing the ones I kill.</String>
		<String _locID="39456">I suggest you build a ship with that and sail far far away.</String>
		<String _locID="39457">Building walls I see. I'd be afraid of me too.</String>
		<String _locID="39458">Walls will not stop the might of my army. They will rip them down like saplings trampled by a stampede of bulls.</String>
		<String _locID="39459">No doubt you are trembling in fear to know I have recruited the locals to join my cause.</String>
		<String _locID="39460">All the more for me.</String>
		<String _locID="39461">Oh ho, look what I have found!</String>
		<String _locID="39462">One more treasure closer to victory.</String>
		<String _locID="39463">Ohh, shiny.</String>
		<String _locID="39464">Now my settlers will grow strong with this bounty.</String>
		<String _locID="39465">While you were off picking flowers I discovered this treasure just outside of your base.</String>
		<String _locID="39466">In case you forgot, collecting treasure is a good thing.</String>
		<String _locID="39467">It's always nice to know the natives are supportive of my efforts.</String>
		<String _locID="39468">Imagine how much more productive my economy will be now.</String>
		<String _locID="39469">I have discovered some lumber just now. What have you done lately?</String>
		<String _locID="39470">Resorting to hiring the natives I see. Typical.</String>
		<String _locID="39471">Do not think that that trade site alone will win you the game.</String>
		<String _locID="39472">Four of a kind might be a sure win in poker, but not in this game.</String>
		<String _locID="39473">Well, one way or another we shall be victorious. Your doom is on the horizon.</String>
		<String _locID="39474">Been letting your kid sister play lately?</String>
		<String _locID="39475">Sooo... which cheat codes have you been using?</String>
		<String _locID="39476">Many games. Many follies I assume.</String>
		<String _locID="39477">We must take out their trading posts now!</String>
		<String _locID="39478">Where is your army? We must stop the counter!</String>
		<String _locID="39479">Stand firm, pet. Victory is nearly ours.</String>
		<String _locID="39480">Keep our trading posts alive and we shall have our victory.</String>
		<String _locID="39481">Where is your artillery, pet?</String>
		<String _locID="39482">Some artillery would teach these dogs a very dear lesson indeed.</String>
		<String _locID="39483">You would do better if you had some cavalry backing up that army.</String>
		<String _locID="39484">I see men, but no horses. Do you think that wise?</String>
		<String _locID="39485">Your ranks are thin. Some infantry would be a wise investment.</String>
		<String _locID="39486">A balanced army requires infantry. You should add some quickly.</String>
		<String _locID="39487">That battle is folly. Rally your men elsewhere.</String>
		<String _locID="39488">You are outgunned, pet. Pull back to safety.</String>
		<String _locID="39489">Madness! You send your men to death!</String>
		<String _locID="39490">Only your enemy and scavengers will benefit from that fight. I suggest a fast retreat.</String>
		<String _locID="39491">Such reckless fighting will only lead to defeat. Save your men for another battle.</String>
		<String _locID="39492">Such a display of strength!</String>
		<String _locID="39493">The battlefield grows crowded.</String>
		<String _locID="39494">Your inexperience as a commander is obvious.</String>
		<String _locID="39495">Whoever put you in charge should have his head examined.</String>
		<String _locID="39496">You won't last long if that is the best you have to offer.</String>
		<String _locID="39497">Your attempts at combat are amusing, but it is the Spanish who are victorious.</String>
		<String _locID="39498">I have underestimated you. I will be more careful in the future.</String>
		<String _locID="39499">Such skill. It is enough to make a girl cry.</String>
		<String _locID="39500">Your troops are strong. I will not make that mistake again.</String>
		<String _locID="39501">How could this have happened? You will pay for this outrage.</String>
		<String _locID="39502">It would seem my troops will need more encouragement after this turn of events.</String>
		<String _locID="39503">I don't want to gloat, but this was too easy.</String>
		<String _locID="39504">See how the dogs fall before my armies?</String>
		<String _locID="39505">At this rate, victory will soon be ours.</String>
		<String _locID="39506">I shall never grow tired of such easy victories.</String>
		<String _locID="39507">All of our foes will soon wear the mark of my boot heel like these now do.</String>
		<String _locID="39508">See how the cowards fall before my soldiers?</String>
		<String _locID="39509">Even my weakest armies can defeat our foes.</String>
		<String _locID="39510">Who would have thought our enemies would roll over and die so willingly.</String>
		<String _locID="39511">Do you see the strength of the Spanish? We are unstoppable.</String>
		<String _locID="39512">Their armies are no match for even my weakest men.</String>
		<String _locID="39513">Don't worry about me, I can easily defeat these dogs.</String>
		<String _locID="39514">Fear not, pet. I have this battle under control.</String>
		<String _locID="39515">Don't trouble your head about this rabble. I will take care of it.</String>
		<String _locID="39516">Since I'm doing all the fighting here, maybe you can engage the enemy somewhere else.</String>
		<String _locID="39517">This battle won't last long, since I have the advantage.</String>
		<String _locID="39518">Your help is not needed here. I will crush the barbarians in moments.</String>
		<String _locID="39519">Your timing is perfect. Onward to victory!</String>
		<String _locID="39520">Thanks for your help, pet. Now let's crush these dogs!</String>
		<String _locID="39521">The enemies multiply before my very eyes. How could this have happened?</String>
		<String _locID="39522">Where did this second foe come from? They will turn the tide of battle.</String>
		<String _locID="39523">Of course, pet.</String>
		<String _locID="39524">Don't think twice about it.</String>
		<String _locID="39525">So demanding. But, all right.</String>
		<String _locID="39526">I concur.</String>
		<String _locID="39527">All right, but you owe me.</String>
		<String _locID="39528">Yes. Artillery will surely ruin their day.</String>
		<String _locID="39529">My subjects will start on that artillery right away.</String>
		<String _locID="39530">Of course, artillery! You are so clever.</String>
		<String _locID="39531">Yes. Some artillery surrounded by cavalry would be splendid.</String>
		<String _locID="39532">You are so smart, pet. I will start right away on the artillery and infantry.</String>
		<String _locID="39533">Some big, strong horsemen will certainly impress the enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="39534">Mighty cavalry from Spain will crush the enemy forces.</String>
		<String _locID="39535">Such powerful beasts manned by fine, Spanish soldiers will soon take the field.</String>
		<String _locID="39536">I have heard your request and concur. I will build cavalry and artillery.</String>
		<String _locID="39537">I am in a good mood. I will build the cavalry and infantry you have asked for.</String>
		<String _locID="39538">I have sent for the finest warriors Spain has to offer. They shall join us soon.</String>
		<String _locID="39539">Yes, I need more men.</String>
		<String _locID="39540">A larger force of men is just what I need.</String>
		<String _locID="39541">Oh, fine. Infantry and artillery are on their way.</String>
		<String _locID="39542">You are a brazen thing. But your request for infantry and cavalry is fair.</String>
		<String _locID="39543">I would love to, pet. But I have many things that need my attention.</String>
		<String _locID="39544">The resources of Spain are not infinite. Be patient.</String>
		<String _locID="39545">You are so demanding. But your request must wait.</String>
		<String _locID="39546">No one may command my men but me.</String>
		<String _locID="39547">Watch yourself, pet. Only I may speak to my generals so.</String>
		<String _locID="39548">Impossible. You ask too much of me.</String>
		<String _locID="39549">It pains me to tell you that I do not have the manpower for that.</String>
		<String _locID="39550">Be patient. I do not have the troops to do that.</String>
		<String _locID="39551">I would help you if I had the troops, but I have none.</String>
		<String _locID="39552">You ask too much.</String>
		<String _locID="39553">I cannot do such a thing.</String>
		<String _locID="39554">Leave me. You ask the impossible.</String>
		<String _locID="39555">I do not have the manpower to help you right now.</String>
		<String _locID="39556">If I had more troops, I would gladly help you.</String>
		<String _locID="39557">Your moves are bold, but I have not the army to help.</String>
		<String _locID="39558">They have broken our hold. We should look closer at our strategy.</String>
		<String _locID="39559">The trading post is destroyed. How dare they do that to me.</String>
		<String _locID="39560">It would appear the island dwellers are almost defeated.</String>
		<String _locID="39561">The Dutch are close to defeat.</String>
		<String _locID="39562">Keep up the pressure, pet. The Dutch will soon fall.</String>
		<String _locID="39563">The French have almost fallen to our combined might.</String>
		<String _locID="39564">The Germans are no match for us.</String>
		<String _locID="39565">Do not stop. The Ottomans are in retreat.</String>
		<String _locID="39566">The cowards! Kneel before Isabella!</String>
		<String _locID="39567">Stay on them. The Russian dogs will lick my boot heels yet.</String>
		<String _locID="39568">There is room in Spain for only one crown. Destroy the Spanish traitors.</String>
		<String _locID="39569">Hiding across the channel has made the British strong.</String>
		<String _locID="39570">The Dutch are strong. We must be cautious.</String>
		<String _locID="39571">Where have the French gained such strength?</String>
		<String _locID="39572">Beware the Germans. They seem particularly strong.</String>
		<String _locID="39573">Could the Ottomans really be this strong?</String>
		<String _locID="39574">The Portuguese have made great strides. Their army is powerful.</String>
		<String _locID="39575">The Russians are a stubborn lot. We will have to redouble our efforts against them.</String>
		<String _locID="39576">It is no surprise that the Spanish are strong. We must be careful.</String>
		<String _locID="39577">You are so strong, pet. But be careful where you spend your resources.</String>
		<String _locID="39578">You have advanced so quickly. I hope it was not too fast.</String>
		<String _locID="39579">Is it really so important for you to be above me?</String>
		<String _locID="39580">The enemy allies with natives. We should be careful.</String>
		<String _locID="39581">They have found native help. Keep an eye out for attacks.</String>
		<String _locID="39582">Our foes consort with the natives. Be wary of attacks.</String>
		<String _locID="39583">You lag behind, pet. Our enemies will have the advantage.</String>
		<String _locID="39584">I hope your strategy includes aging up to Colonial soon.</String>
		<String _locID="39585">If you don't at least go Colonial soon, our enemies will have the advantage.</String>
		<String _locID="39586">Why do you lag behind?</String>
		<String _locID="39587">It is nice to have you behind me, but our foes will win if you stay there.</String>
		<String _locID="39588">Why are you so slow to Age up? Our enemies will have an advantage if you don't advance.</String>
		<String _locID="39589">So fast! But leave some resources for other things.</String>
		<String _locID="39590">You are quick, pet. But will you be able to support your colony?</String>
		<String _locID="39591">Finally! I was beginning to think you would never join the rest of us.</String>
		<String _locID="39592">If you are so slow at everything, we will never triumph.</String>
		<String _locID="39593">Such a bold rescue! You have my nation's gratitude.</String>
		<String _locID="39594">Saved at last! You are so brave and so helpful.</String>
		<String _locID="39595">Ah, my explorer lives. Your kindness is unequaled.</String>
		<String _locID="39596">I will not tolerate such sneaky maneuvers.</String>
		<String _locID="39597">Such underhanded methods will not go unpunished.</String>
		<String _locID="39598">Such obvious tactics only make me sad.</String>
		<String _locID="39599">The natives are free of our enemy's subversion.</String>
		<String _locID="39600">I have removed the yoke of our foes from these people.</String>
		<String _locID="39601">I have removed our enemy's corruption from these native peoples.</String>
		<String _locID="39602">The enemy town lies in ashes beneath my boots.</String>
		<String _locID="39603">How glorious to see the ruins of our enemy's buildings.</String>
		<String _locID="39604">All our enemies will fall as this town did.</String>
		<String _locID="39605">The enemy will not exploit this trade route anymore.</String>
		<String _locID="39606">This trading post fell easily. Why wasn't it more heavily guarded?</String>
		<String _locID="39607">And that, pet, is how you destroy a trading post.</String>
		<String _locID="39608">The natives here are strong. I must be more careful.</String>
		<String _locID="39609">Where were you? I could have used your help.</String>
		<String _locID="39610">This town was well defended. We need to bring more troops next time.</String>
		<String _locID="39611">I could have used some more help attacking this town.</String>
		<String _locID="39612">The trade site still stands. We need to focus more power there.</String>
		<String _locID="39613">This post was too well guarded. I have better things to do anyway.</String>
		<String _locID="39614">My explorer is too hasty. He will get a spanking when he returns.</String>
		<String _locID="39615">Why does he run into trouble like that? I will not be able to gather treasures until he revives.</String>
		<String _locID="39616">My explorer is down. Be a dear and go find him.</String>
		<String _locID="39617">The dangers of the New World are many, as my explorer has found out.</String>
		<String _locID="39618">My explorer has succumbed to the environment.</String>
		<String _locID="39619">The wilds have claimed another son of Spain.</String>
		<String _locID="39620">The enemy is too strong. We should bow out gracefully.</String>
		<String _locID="39621">I cannot keep throwing resources at this folly. I am ready to resign.</String>
		<String _locID="39622">You fought bravely, pet. But we are done.</String>
		<String _locID="39623">I grow weary of events in the New World. We should stop.</String>
		<String _locID="39624">I knew coming here was a bad idea. I want to recall my people.</String>
		<String _locID="39625">Your strength is needed here.</String>
		<String _locID="39626">Send troops here, pet.</String>
		<String _locID="39627">I have run into the enemy. Send an army here.</String>
		<String _locID="39628">I cannot handle so many men. Send help now.</String>
		<String _locID="39629">The enemy has swarmed into my town. I need help.</String>
		<String _locID="39630">Send help, pet. I don't have the army to repel this attack.</String>
		<String _locID="39631">I hope you are stronger than my last ally.</String>
		<String _locID="39632">Greetings, pet. It is a pleasure to have you at my side.</String>
		<String _locID="39633">Together, we will soon have the enemy begging for mercy.</String>
		<String _locID="39634">You are brave to try again at a higher difficulty.</String>
		<String _locID="39635">I hope your brazen jump in difficulty does not end in disappointment.</String>
		<String _locID="39636">Are you sure this jump in difficulty was not a mistake?</String>
		<String _locID="39637">I see you are taking it a little easier this time. That is probably best.</String>
		<String _locID="39638">Did the higher difficulty not agree with you?</String>
		<String _locID="39639">It is probably best for you to stay here a while before you try to move up again.</String>
		<String _locID="39640">It will be nice not to be on the receiving end of your assault this time.</String>
		<String _locID="39641">Your score was most impressive last time. I will do my best to keep up.</String>
		<String _locID="39642">Did you like the taste of my boot? I will try not to be so rough this time.</String>
		<String _locID="39643">You need to keep up, pet. Try to get your score up higher this time.</String>
		<String _locID="39644">Do you remember the time we spent here together the last time?</String>
		<String _locID="39645">You need to do better this game if you want to keep from making me cry.</String>
		<String _locID="39646">Your performance last time was less than impressive. Do better this time.</String>
		<String _locID="39647">You had an impressive game last time. I am looking forward to a repeat performance.</String>
		<String _locID="39648">I am glad you are here with me again.</String>
		<String _locID="39649">Since you are incapable of rescuing my explorer, I have sent his ransom.</String>
		<String _locID="39650">Curse my explorer's brashness. He has cost me dear today.</String>
		<String _locID="39651">My explorer is back, but it cost me dearly.</String>
		<String _locID="39652">I have rescued my explorer. Our foes can choke on their ransom demands.</String>
		<String _locID="39653">My explorer is back, now that I have rescued him.</String>
		<String _locID="39654">Since you have waited so long, I have rescued my explorer myself.</String>
		<String _locID="39655">I have grown tired waiting for you and have rescued my explorer myself.</String>
		<String _locID="39656">Where is their army? Is our foe so foolish as to leave his town undefended?</String>
		<String _locID="39657">Look, pet. Our enemy has left this tasty morsel undefended.</String>
		<String _locID="39658">This town is ripe for the picking, with no barracks to defend it.</String>
		<String _locID="39659">A town without a barracks is like an explorer without my jewels. It's not going to get very far.</String>
		<String _locID="39660">This town has no stable. Send in the artillery.</String>
		<String _locID="39661">This coin should help you with the cause.</String>
		<String _locID="39662">I hope this coin helps to sustain you.</String>
		<String _locID="39663">You need food to keep your stamina.</String>
		<String _locID="39664">Take this food to keep your men strong.</String>
		<String _locID="39665">Spanish wood built the armada. Use this to power our victory.</String>
		<String _locID="39666">This wood will keep your forces strong.</String>
		<String _locID="39667">There is no substitute for Spanish wood!</String>
		<String _locID="39668">Our foes will soon taste Spanish steel.</String>
		<String _locID="39669">My forces are moving forward to attack our enemy's base.</String>
		<String _locID="39670">This base will feel the stamp of my boot heel.</String>
		<String _locID="39671">These gatherers will rue the day their country took on the Spanish.</String>
		<String _locID="39672">The fools have left these people to die at my hand.</String>
		<String _locID="39673">No quarter shall be given to any enemy of the Spanish.</String>
		<String _locID="39674">My forces are moving to take the main enemy town.</String>
		<String _locID="39675">The sons of Spain will soon be masters of this town.</String>
		<String _locID="39676">Come bask in my glory as we dismantle this town.</String>
		<String _locID="39677">These natives will soon be free of their captors.</String>
		<String _locID="39678">It is time to let these people know how they are being deceived.</String>
		<String _locID="39679">Let us remove the blindfold put on these natives by our enemies.</String>
		<String _locID="39680">Our enemies get too much from this trade site.</String>
		<String _locID="39681">This trade site has profited our foes for too long.</String>
		<String _locID="39682">Stand firm, pet. The sons of Spain are on their way to join you.</String>
		<String _locID="39683">You are so bold to attack there. I will send you help.</String>
		<String _locID="39684">Brilliant! I will join you soon.</String>
		<String _locID="39685">I need more men. A base will be perfect here.</String>
		<String _locID="39686">Careful, pet. I am putting a military base here.</String>
		<String _locID="39687">I will put a base here. Would you care to join me?</String>
		<String _locID="39688">As Spain prospers, I will need more room.</String>
		<String _locID="39689">This is a perfect spot for a town center.</String>
		<String _locID="39690">The riches of Spain will allow me to put another town center here.</String>
		<String _locID="39691">I will build another town center here to the glory of Spain.</String>
		<String _locID="39692">I am going to seek help from these native peoples.</String>
		<String _locID="39693">These natives will make a powerful ally.</String>
		<String _locID="39694">With the help of these people, we will be unstoppable.</String>
		<String _locID="39695">I will ask these people for help in defeating our common foe.</String>
		<String _locID="39696">This trade site will help to fuel our victory.</String>
		<String _locID="39697">Watch my back while I build a trade site here.</String>
		<String _locID="39698">The dogs will not get their teeth into this building.</String>
		<String _locID="39699">I will defend this building, pet.</String>
		<String _locID="39700">My forces will hold this spot to their dying breath.</String>
		<String _locID="39701">The enemy will not get past me here.</String>
		<String _locID="39702">This village is mine. I won't let them take it away.</String>
		<String _locID="39703">These people need my help. I will defend them.</String>
		<String _locID="39704">The enemy draws near. I will need to defend this town.</String>
		<String _locID="39705">The dogs will not take this town from the Spanish.</String>
		<String _locID="39706">I will be defending this trade site, pet.</String>
		<String _locID="39707">I will defend here at this trade site.</String>
		<String _locID="39708">Watch your coffers. I will keep sending coin.</String>
		<String _locID="39709">Did you enjoy that? I will send more soon.</String>
		<String _locID="39710">More food will be arriving when I am able to send it.</String>
		<String _locID="39711">Fear not, pet. More food is on the way.</String>
		<String _locID="39712">There is more wood where that came from.</String>
		<String _locID="39713">Did that wood make you smile? You will get another surprise soon.</String>
		<String _locID="39714">Stand fast. Help is on the way.</String>
		<String _locID="39715">My men are on the way to your location.</String>
		<String _locID="39716">The dogs will pay for attacking you here when my troops arrive.</String>
		<String _locID="39717">Tell me you love me.</String>
		<String _locID="39718">Such quiet. Are you mad at me?</String>
		<String _locID="39719">Playing the strong, silent type?</String>
		<String _locID="39720">Be a dear and send me some coin.</String>
		<String _locID="39721">Some coin would really help our cause right now.</String>
		<String _locID="39722">Send me some coin and I will make it worth your while.</String>
		<String _locID="39723">Some food would be appreciated.</String>
		<String _locID="39724">Do you have any food to feed the sons of Spain?</String>
		<String _locID="39725">The Spanish empire needs food to fight the enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="39726">I could really use some wood.</String>
		<String _locID="39727">Do you have some wood for me?</String>
		<String _locID="39728">I seem to really be burning through the wood. Can you give me some?</String>
		<String _locID="39729">Your help is appreciated. Now lets move our forces forward.</String>
		<String _locID="39730">That went so much better after you joined in.</String>
		<String _locID="39731">Our combined offensive force cannot be stopped.</String>
		<String _locID="39732">Your gift of coin is most appreciated.</String>
		<String _locID="39733">You are so good to me.</String>
		<String _locID="39734">This food will go far.</String>
		<String _locID="39735">The Spanish people thank you for your generosity.</String>
		<String _locID="39736">Your help was most generous.</String>
		<String _locID="39737">I must think of some way to thank you.</String>
		<String _locID="39738">Your men arrived in the nick of time.</String>
		<String _locID="39739">I am overflowing. You are too generous.</String>
		<String _locID="39740">Are you trying to impress me with your mighty economy?</String>
		<String _locID="39741">Your gift of wood was generous.</String>
		<String _locID="39742">So much wood! You are too kind.</String>
		<String _locID="39743">These island dwellers are powerful. We are in trouble.</String>
		<String _locID="39744">Curse the British! They are a powerful foe.</String>
		<String _locID="39745">The Dutch are so powerful. Is there nothing we can do to stop them?</String>
		<String _locID="39746">The cursed French are winning this day.</String>
		<String _locID="39747">These Ottomans are worthy foes. I have underestimated them.</String>
		<String _locID="39748">The Portuguese dogs! Where did they learn to fight so well?</String>
		<String _locID="39749">The Russians are overpowering us with numbers.</String>
		<String _locID="39750">It is no surprise the Spanish are strong, but they should be fighting for me.</String>
		<String _locID="39751">How can these weak British be doing so well?</String>
		<String _locID="39752">Despite the weakness of the Dutch, we are losing.</String>
		<String _locID="39753">How can this be? The French dogs are weak, but we are still losing.</String>
		<String _locID="39754">Despite Germany's weakness, we are being routed.</String>
		<String _locID="39755">How do we expect to win when we can't even handle a weak Portuguese force?</String>
		<String _locID="39756">The Russians fall before our forces, but we still can't push the advantage.</String>
		<String _locID="39757">This renegade group of Spanish is no match for the crown, but I fear we have lost.</String>
		<String _locID="39758">I have let you down.</String>
		<String _locID="39759">You are so strong, but my forces are falling too quickly.</String>
		<String _locID="39760">I had hoped you would be strong for me.</String>
		<String _locID="39761">You disappoint me, and we will both suffer for it.</String>
		<String _locID="39762">The enemy is in disarray. We make a good team.</String>
		<String _locID="39763">We should press our advantage while we are ahead.</String>
		<String _locID="39764">You are so strong!</String>
		<String _locID="39765">It would seem I have chosen a strong ally.</String>
		<String _locID="39766">You will need to do better if you want to keep up with me.</String>
		<String _locID="39767">War is not for the weak. You must work harder to keep favor with the Spanish.</String>
		<String _locID="39768">We are done. Spain has nothing left for this game.</String>
		<String _locID="39769">I am spent. We have lost the day.</String>
		<String _locID="39770">Did you not hear me? We are defeated.</String>
		<String _locID="39771">Your intent to fight on is noble, but it will get you naught.</String>
		<String _locID="39772">Your insistence on continuing this fight is folly. I will not add to your body count.</String>
		<String _locID="39773">You waste resources on this lost cause. When will you see the truth?</String>
		<String _locID="39774">Those rascals have gathered 4 trading posts. We must act quickly.</String>
		<String _locID="39775">We must hurry or they will attain a four of a kind victory.</String>
		<String _locID="39776">Our enemies extend their influence over the natives.</String>
		<String _locID="39777">The natives have fallen victim to our enemies' influence.</String>
		<String _locID="39778">Our foes have set up a trade site.</String>
		<String _locID="39779">The enemy has a trade site. We should be careful they do not get more.</String>
		<String _locID="39780">The enemy continues to gather natives. Are we going to let them get away with that?</String>
		<String _locID="39781">They continue to dominate the local natives. We should do something to lift their oppression.</String>
		<String _locID="39782">They have another trade site. We should crush them.</String>
		<String _locID="39783">They continue to pursue trade sites. Be careful they don't get any more.</String>
		<String _locID="39784">You are so smart to keep the enemy from oppressing these people.</String>
		<String _locID="39785">Good thinking! We can use the help of the natives.</String>
		<String _locID="39786">Nice work! That trade site will come in handy.</String>
		<String _locID="39787">Brilliant! You are smart to get a trade site before anyone else.</String>
		<String _locID="39788">So fast! You are a quick one.</String>
		<String _locID="39789">You don't wait for anything, do you?</String>
		<String _locID="39790">Nothing stands in your way, does it?</String>
		<String _locID="39791">Your explorer is quite bold.</String>
		<String _locID="39792">That coin will certainly come in handy.</String>
		<String _locID="39793">A girl could really get behind an ally with so much coin.</String>
		<String _locID="39794">That will satisfy many appetites.</String>
		<String _locID="39795">Just seeing that food makes me ravenous.</String>
		<String _locID="39796">Do you do everything so quickly?</String>
		<String _locID="39797">Your proficiency is impressive.</String>
		<String _locID="39798">You are very forward to be nosing around here.</String>
		<String _locID="39799">What, don't you get enough over in your own area?</String>
		<String _locID="39800">I will thank you to keep your hands off my treasures.</String>
		<String _locID="39801">You can use that native to scout.</String>
		<String _locID="39802">Ask that native to scout the surrounding wilderness.</String>
		<String _locID="39803">Liberated settlers are hard workers.</String>
		<String _locID="39804">Free the people and they will gladly work for you.</String>
		<String _locID="39805">There is wood everywhere in this New World.</String>
		<String _locID="39806">You are lucky to find extra wood.</String>
		<String _locID="39807">Ah, we have more allies now.</String>
		<String _locID="39808">You are wise to gain more favor with the natives.</String>
		<String _locID="39809">Another trade site! You are bold, pet.</String>
		<String _locID="39810">We have the trade advantage now.</String>
		<String _locID="39811">I hope those walls will keep our foes out.</String>
		<String _locID="39812">Walls! A wise choice to make.</String>
		<String _locID="39813">I have been able to gain favor with the local natives.</String>
		<String _locID="39814">We have the native advantage now.</String>
		<String _locID="39815">This trade site was too good to pass up.</String>
		<String _locID="39816">How can we lose when I have gained the first trade site?</String>
		<String _locID="39817">There is no stopping me once I get started.</String>
		<String _locID="39818">See this treasure just waiting for me to find it?</String>
		<String _locID="39819">This treasure will look beautiful in the Prado.</String>
		<String _locID="39820">A girl could buy a lot with coin like this.</String>
		<String _locID="39821">If you are nice, some of this could be yours.</String>
		<String _locID="39822">Mmmm. Yummy food.</String>
		<String _locID="39823">This will go far to nourish the sons of Spain.</String>
		<String _locID="39824">You are so slow. I will take this one!</String>
		<String _locID="39825">Don't be mad at me, pet.</String>
		<String _locID="39826">Where is your explorer? Why is he not collecting treasures?</String>
		<String _locID="39827">Your explorer is lazy. He should be collecting treasures.</String>
		<String _locID="39828">Look at the men. This was a good treasure.</String>
		<String _locID="39829">See how the warriors flock to me? Are you jealous?</String>
		<String _locID="39830">The more people I find, the stronger my economy becomes.</String>
		<String _locID="39831">These poor souls will gladly work for a kind savior like me.</String>
		<String _locID="39832">Look at the wood!</String>
		<String _locID="39833">This wood will go far to build my colony.</String>
		<String _locID="39834">I have put us ahead in natives.</String>
		<String _locID="39835">We have gained the advantage in natives again.</String>
		<String _locID="39836">My trade site has put us ahead.</String>
		<String _locID="39837">We may have been tied for some time, but now we are ahead again.</String>
		<String _locID="39838">These walls will not keep you out, pet.</String>
		<String _locID="39839">The enemy will find a surprise when he runs into these walls.</String>
		<String _locID="39840">We need to hold on to these trading posts. Be ready for an immediate attack.</String>
		<String _locID="39841">The enemy will surely be looking to attack our trading posts now.</String>
		<String _locID="39842">What has happened, pet? You used to be much stronger.</String>
		<String _locID="39843">I see life in the colonies has not agreed with you.</String>
		<String _locID="39844">You have grown so strong since the last time we played.</String>
		<String _locID="39845">I like to think it was me that made you so powerful.</String>
		<String _locID="39846">You have been busy, pet. Where did you get all of that experience?</String>
		<String _locID="39847">You are certainly a lot more experienced than I remember.</String>
		<String _locID="39848">You are a beast, sneaking around and collecting trade posts this way.</String>
		<String _locID="39849">I cannot lose this way. You had better hope those trading posts are well defended.</String>
		<String _locID="39850">Hah! There is nothing you can do to stop us now.</String>
		<String _locID="39851">We are winning. You have nothing.</String>
		<String _locID="39852">I see you like it rough.</String>
		<String _locID="39853">Why is it I always seem to get double-teamed?</String>
		<String _locID="39854">Your soldiers' blood is on your hands.</String>
		<String _locID="39855">You send your men into certain death.</String>
		<String _locID="39857">See how we work as a team? You will face this all day.</String>
		<String _locID="39858">There is nothing I can't do with my ally behind me.</String>
		<String _locID="39859">You are lucky your ally has saved you. This time.</String>
		<String _locID="39860">So mean of you to gang up on poor me.</String>
		<String _locID="39861">You would be wiser to spend your resources on smarter things.</String>
		<String _locID="39862">Such free-spending is not going to impress me.</String>
		<String _locID="39863">You can not be so far ahead of me. You are spending most foolishly.</String>
		<String _locID="39864">The natives will not be fooled by your lies for long.</String>
		<String _locID="39865">Those natives will see you for what you are one day.</String>
		<String _locID="39866">You are lucky those men have chosen to ally with you.</String>
		<String _locID="39867">How dare you! These natives are my friends.</String>
		<String _locID="39868">You will regret that.</String>
		<String _locID="39869">Why are you picking on me?</String>
		<String _locID="39870">Leave my town alone!</String>
		<String _locID="39871">You weren't invited into my town. Go away.</String>
		<String _locID="39872">That trade site was mine!</String>
		<String _locID="39873">Why do you destroy my things?</String>
		<String _locID="39874">Eh. I will have that trade site back up in no time.</String>
		<String _locID="39875">Why do you languish in backwards times?</String>
		<String _locID="39876">You are so slow! You will never catch up to me now.</String>
		<String _locID="39877">I am so far ahead of you, you will never catch up!</String>
		<String _locID="39878">My forces are far superior to yours.</String>
		<String _locID="39879">Your advanced technology will make a splendid prize when my armies roll through your town.</String>
		<String _locID="39880">You may be first to Age up, but you will be last when the score is tallied.</String>
		<String _locID="39881">First to Age up is first to die.</String>
		<String _locID="39882">You had better get some troops out quickly, now that you have joined the rest of us in the modern world.</String>
		<String _locID="39883">Oh, you are alive. I was going to check for a pulse.</String>
		<String _locID="39884">Finally. I would be sad if my troops had no one to fight.</String>
		<String _locID="39885">Does your ally dislike you so much that he makes you build so far away from him?</String>
		<String _locID="39886">It must be very lonely for you to be so far away from your friends. I will send some men to keep you company.</String>
		<String _locID="39887">It was nice of you to save my troops from a long walk as they move from town to town.</String>
		<String _locID="39888">You will know my cannon are near when you hear them knocking down your ally's town.</String>
		<String _locID="39889">Are you really so scared that you need to stay so close to your ally?</String>
		<String _locID="39890">Hah! So much for your sneaky tactics.</String>
		<String _locID="39891">Did you not think I would be aware of your tactics?</String>
		<String _locID="39892">Those people are now free of your tyranny.</String>
		<String _locID="39893">You have no hold on these people now.</String>
		<String _locID="39894">That felt sooo good.</String>
		<String _locID="39895">I hope you felt that to your core.</String>
		<String _locID="39896">It will be a long time before you feel the gain from that trade site again.</String>
		<String _locID="39897">I hope that you didn't need that trade site too much.</String>
		<String _locID="39898">You seem to be a reasonable person, would you care to give up now?</String>
		<String _locID="39899">Surrender now and you will save yourself a lot of pain.</String>
		<String _locID="39901">Do you think it wise to attempt a more difficult setting this time? No matter. I will crush you regardless.</String>
		<String _locID="39902">I am disappointed that you are not the player I thought you were.</String>
		<String _locID="39903">It would seem that we were destined to meet here again.</String>
		<String _locID="39904">It won't matter how easy you try to make things on yourself. I will still see you beneath the heel of my boot.</String>
		<String _locID="39905">You are so brave to take on more enemies, but that will only increase your pain.</String>
		<String _locID="39906">Choke on your ransom, you dogs.</String>
		<String _locID="39907">I am sad that you must resort to kidnapping to finance your petty colony.</String>
		<String _locID="39908">Hello there, little man. Are you looking for treasure?</String>
		<String _locID="39909">Be careful out in the wilds, pet. There are many dangers waiting for you.</String>
		<String _locID="39910">This is the best army you can muster? And where are they going?</String>
		<String _locID="39911">It would appear your men have abandoned their leader and are looking to slink away like the dogs they are.</String>
		<String _locID="39913">I would love to get to know your men better, but I won't have time before they are annihilated.</String>
		<String _locID="39914">Oh look. Are these some deserters of yours, looking for a better life in Spain?</String>
		<String _locID="39915">I might have known I would find you attacking defenseless settlers.</String>
		<String _locID="39916">You can kill one or a hundred of us, but Spain will always triumph.</String>
		<String _locID="39917">You are no better than dogs, attacking unarmed civilians like that.</String>
		<String _locID="39918">These soldiers will make excellent target practice for my army.</String>
		<String _locID="39919">I had no idea hunting season had opened. Stay there, my army is on its way.</String>
		<String _locID="39920">I see your army is guarding that strategic field.</String>
		<String _locID="39921">You call that an army? No wonder they cower in the fields.</String>
		<String _locID="39922">Is that all you have? Come back when you are bigger.</String>
		<String _locID="39923">That so-called army is hardly worthy of the name.</String>
		<String _locID="39924">Well, isn't this an interesting turn of events.</String>
		<String _locID="39925">You may take my town, but you will never have my crown.</String>
		<String _locID="39926">Look at those lost lambs. I will give them a good home.</String>
		<String _locID="39927">What's this? More stragglers seeking comfort in the arms of Spain?</String>
		<String _locID="39929">There you are. It won't be long before Spanish flags wave from the windows.</String>
		<String _locID="39930">What a lovely spot. I think my cannon will go... there.</String>
		<String _locID="39931">Hello. Don't get too comfortable in those buildings.</String>
		<String _locID="39932">You are so kind to let a lady go first.</String>
		<String _locID="39933">Your kindness will not go unpunished.</String>
		<String _locID="39934">Find your own treasures, dog.</String>
		<String _locID="39935">I hope you have saved some ammunition. You are going to need it.</String>
		<String _locID="39936">I hope that cake is ready, because here I come!</String>
		<String _locID="39937">Is that silence the sound of your corpse?</String>
		<String _locID="39938">I have heard more noise coming from a morgue.</String>
		<String _locID="39939">Let me know when you have finished your snack.</String>
		<String _locID="39940">It was nice of you to let me get some beauty sleep.</String>
		<String _locID="39941">You play too rough. I would like to stop now.</String>
		<String _locID="39942">Please let me leave here with some shred of dignity.</String>
		<String _locID="39943">I am done. You can stop now.</String>
		<String _locID="39944">You were lucky this time.</String>
		<String _locID="39945">Impressive, but you are only delaying the inevitable.</String>
		<String _locID="39946">An interesting strategy, but tricking the local natives will not help you.</String>
		<String _locID="39947">I see you like giving me lots of targets.</String>
		<String _locID="39948">Enjoy your spoils while you can, because that site will soon be in flames.</String>
		<String _locID="39949">So many wasted resources. You will be sad when I destroy that trade site.</String>
		<String _locID="39950">I hope you don't do everything so quickly.</String>
		<String _locID="39951">You are fast, but it takes more than speed to best me.</String>
		<String _locID="39952">This world holds many treasures for you, including the heel of my boot.</String>
		<String _locID="39953">Keep that treasure safe for me when I come to collect it from the smoking ashes of your town center.</String>
		<String _locID="39954">You should fight me instead of scurrying through the brush looking for trinkets.</String>
		<String _locID="39955">That coin will not buy you fame here in the New World.</String>
		<String _locID="39956">Strength is measured in power, not mere coin. You will need both to impress me.</String>
		<String _locID="39957">Enjoy that food now, you will soon be eating Spanish steel.</String>
		<String _locID="39958">That food will go well with the knives we have for your soldier's bellies.</String>
		<String _locID="39959">An impressive display of baubles, but you should pay more attention to your colony.</String>
		<String _locID="39960">Your explorer should be careful wandering so far from home.</String>
		<String _locID="39961">Who is this? Be careful out there little man.</String>
		<String _locID="39962">So far from home, it would be a shame if you met with some accident.</String>
		<String _locID="39963">Those natives can't help you if you are dead.</String>
		<String _locID="39964">It would be a shame if the natives learned of your true nature.</String>
		<String _locID="39965">Is there not a person in the colonies who does not wish they were born Spanish?</String>
		<String _locID="39966">You may send the settlers this way if you want them to live beyond today.</String>
		<String _locID="39967">You may want to use that wood to build coffins for your men.</String>
		<String _locID="39968">It won't be long before that wood is fueling your pyre.</String>
		<String _locID="39969">A wall? Is this to keep the enemy out or your soldiers in?</String>
		<String _locID="39970">No wall can protect you from the sting of Spanish steel.</String>
		<String _locID="39971">See how the locals flock to me? They will be your undoing.</String>
		<String _locID="39972">It would seem the natives have chosen to support the winning side.</String>
		<String _locID="39973">Such bounty will give me the advantage I need to crush you.</String>
		<String _locID="39974">Are you afraid to get your own trade site for fear I will destroy it?</String>
		<String _locID="39975">Look at this. More riches for the Spanish cause.</String>
		<String _locID="39976">The treasures practically jump at me.</String>
		<String _locID="39977">Are you jealous that such a fine treasure is mine?</String>
		<String _locID="39978">This coin will pay for many Spanish soldiers.</String>
		<String _locID="39979">Look at all of this coin. Do you need to borrow some?</String>
		<String _locID="39980">Wherever will I store all of this food?</String>
		<String _locID="39981">I may need to build another town center to store all of this food.</String>
		<String _locID="39982">Oh look. You have forgotten one. I will take care of it.</String>
		<String _locID="39983">Is your explorer so blind as to miss things right under his very nose?</String>
		<String _locID="39984">You should go to the tavern and tell your explorer to get started soon.</String>
		<String _locID="39985">Was that your explorer I saw napping in a field?</String>
		<String _locID="39986">This New World holds many treasures. It is too bad that you do not.</String>
		<String _locID="39987">These natives have chosen to side with the victors.</String>
		<String _locID="39988">The natives here will enjoy victory when we crush you.</String>
		<String _locID="39989">Who wouldn't want to join a queen as lovely as I am?</String>
		<String _locID="39990">It is good that these people come work for me, rather than dying in your town.</String>
		<String _locID="39991">This wood will make arrows to pierce your very heart.</String>
		<String _locID="39992">Should I use this wood to build or destroy?</String>
		<String _locID="39993">Those people will not help you in the long run.</String>
		<String _locID="39994">It would be a shame if someone were to come along and knock that post down.</String>
		<String _locID="39995">That is a cute trade site. I am going to enjoy watching it burn.</String>
		<String _locID="39996">Don't think that trade site will give you any advantage.</String>
		<String _locID="39997">An interesting tactic, but you should have worried about protecting your towns.</String>
		<String _locID="39998">What good is this when you have no army to protect them?</String>
		<String _locID="39999">Do you hear that? That is the clock ticking down on your defeat.</String>
		<String _locID="40000">Don't mind those posts. They are only going to win us the game.</String>
		<String _locID="40001">Whatever happened to you? I thought you used to be somebody.</String>
		<String _locID="40002">Don't worry. That happens to lots of people. I guess.</String>
		<String _locID="40003">I see you have come a long way - a long way to die.</String>
		<String _locID="40004">You have improved since the last time we met. But you will still taste my boot heel.</String>
		<String _locID="40005">You have gained much experience since I saw you last. But you have not learned how to win.</String>
		<String _locID="40006">That experience won't help you. In fact, it will only make my victory all the sweeter.</String>
		<String _locID="40007">Bonuses like this can only hasten your destruction.</String>
		<String _locID="40008">This treasure has already been invested in the weapons I will use to demolish your puny nation.</String>
		<String _locID="40009">Such a discovery is unique! Surely you have nothing like it.</String>
		<String _locID="40010">Go ahead, scavenge while you can.</String>
		<String _locID="40011">Your men rummage through the brush like rodents, looking for tasty tidbits. Soon I bring a bayonet for you to bite on instead.</String>
		<String _locID="40012">You gather loot like a vulture, instead of soaring like the Russian eagle.</String>
		<String _locID="40013">You are off to a quick start, but the outcome is not in doubt.</String>
		<String _locID="40014">Such talent at killing bandits and wild animals. We'll see how you do against my disciplined army.</String>
		<String _locID="40015">Your lack of skill at treasure hunting probably demonstrates that you will be surprised by the size of my army.</String>
		<String _locID="40016">That treasure was MINE. You will regret this, little one.</String>
		<String _locID="40017">I gather treasure where I please, because I know you cannot stop me.</String>
		<String _locID="40018">Your primitive town structure is proof of your incompetence. Your soldiers will still be using sticks and knives while mine have gunpowder.</String>
		<String _locID="40019">Your high technology will remain but a bittersweet memory  when my Cossacks burn your town.</String>
		<String _locID="40020">Your Age advancement is too little, too late.</String>
		<String _locID="40021">Such speedy advancement in Age means you are neglecting military production. You shall learn the hard way how wrong your priorities are.</String>
		<String _locID="40022">Do not take it too hard when my men raze your fine new buildings.</String>
		<String _locID="40023">While you progress in Age, I sharpen my saber. A blade through the heart kills even the most advanced soldier type.</String>
		<String _locID="40024">My armies will crush you with their superior technology.</String>
		<String _locID="40025">I see your town. I can already hear my armies march down your streets.</String>
		<String _locID="40026">Your towns are so close; like little lambs huddled together in fear.</String>
		<String _locID="40027">You have rashly isolated your town. I can now crush you and your ally piecemeal.</String>
		<String _locID="40028">I have saved my explorer. Now I shall punish you for his temporary captivity.</String>
		<String _locID="40029">Yes you wounded my explorer, but now he is back, and thirsting for revenge.</String>
		<String _locID="40030">You may have caught my explorer, but you could not keep him.</String>
		<String _locID="40031">The natives are foolish to ally with your cause.</String>
		<String _locID="40032">Is THAT your army? It's so small... it must be a decoy.</String>
		<String _locID="40033">That force seems too big for a band of scouts. You must think it is an army.</String>
		<String _locID="40034">You are letting your men wander too far from home. Did they lose their way?</String>
		<String _locID="40035">I see your army. Sadly, it's not large enough to merit concern.</String>
		<String _locID="40036">I have spotted your invasion force. Now I can cut it off and destroy it.</String>
		<String _locID="40037">There you are. Bring on your puny assault! I am ready.</String>
		<String _locID="40038">I see your invading army. So large... your home base must be defenseless!</String>
		<String _locID="40039">Your large but undisciplined mass of soldiers does not frighten me.</String>
		<String _locID="40040">I see you're hoping to invade me. I must stop you cold.</String>
		<String _locID="40041">Attacking my settlers?! You will pay for this.</String>
		<String _locID="40042">Apparently your men are only good against unarmed civilians.</String>
		<String _locID="40043">My economy is powerful enough to withstand your pinpricks.</String>
		<String _locID="40044">This isn't right... the war was supposed to be in YOUR town.</String>
		<String _locID="40045">What are you doing? How can you be HERE? No!</String>
		<String _locID="40046">You cannot take the credit for this victory. I'm sure I was betrayed by my own jealous underlings.</String>
		<String _locID="40047">This may not be the end, but it is at least the beginning of the end.</String>
		<String _locID="40048">Surrender now to avoid the humiliation of being utterly crushed.</String>
		<String _locID="40049">We will crush every inch of your civilization under our boots.</String>
		<String _locID="40050">My sword rusts from disuse. Are you ever going to attack?</String>
		<String _locID="40051">Enjoy the lull. My troops train diligently while you idle away your future.</String>
		<String _locID="40052">Are you still there?</String>
		<String _locID="40053">I intend to crush the enemy's outlying base here.</String>
		<String _locID="40054">Sir! Hands off the discoveries near my town. They are for me!</String>
		<String _locID="40055">I can't afford to do that... yet.</String>
		<String _locID="40056">You will have to wait. Please ask again later.</String>
		<String _locID="40057">I have no money, so I cannot assist you.</String>
		<String _locID="40058">I do not have an army yet, or I would rush to your aid.</String>
		<String _locID="40059">You will have to fight on your own for the nonce. I cannot help.</String>
		<String _locID="40060">Wait until I build an army!</String>
		<String _locID="40061">Soon I will have a mighty army. But not yet.</String>
		<String _locID="40062">My army is not yet large enough to help you.</String>
		<String _locID="40063">I am not prepared to attack the enemy yet.</String>
		<String _locID="40064">Yes! Brilliant!</String>
		<String _locID="40065">Stealing my treasure? I suppose we ARE on the same side. Aren't we?</String>
		<String _locID="40066">At once!</String>
		<String _locID="40067">Of course!</String>
		<String _locID="40068">That action is forbidden to me.</String>
		<String _locID="40069">I am not able to follow your orders.</String>
		<String _locID="40070">Yes - artillery to demolish his buildings, plus a few horsemen to run down his settlers.</String>
		<String _locID="40071">Hmm. Artillery fortified by my sturdy infantry should be well-nigh unbeatable!</String>
		<String _locID="40072">Yes, artillery! An unstoppable barrage of cannonball!</String>
		<String _locID="40073">With enough cannon we can sweep the enemy away.</String>
		<String _locID="40074">We Russians are good at training cavalry. Perhaps this is a job for my Cossacks... and of course some artillery to knock down any annoying infantry that might get in our way.</String>
		<String _locID="40075">Horsemen to trample the foe beneath their hooves! Plus some infantry to clean up anything that survives.</String>
		<String _locID="40076">Excellent. You are already on your way!</String>
		<String _locID="40077">I shall train infantry. Infantry and a few artillery pieces for show.</String>
		<String _locID="40078">Hordes of infantry is what we Russians are best at producing. A few cavalry to fill in the cracks and we will have a fine force.</String>
		<String _locID="40079">Endless waves of horsemen from the steppes will be a fine sight.</String>
		<String _locID="40080">Cavalry are the answer to our problems.</String>
		<String _locID="40081">You are right. I need more infantry. One can never have enough.</String>
		<String _locID="40082">I shall train an endless horde of infantry.</String>
		<String _locID="40083">Ha! A free settler!</String>
		<String _locID="40084">You are rich!</String>
		<String _locID="40085">Food is always welcome.</String>
		<String _locID="40086">You know - free warriors like that make excellent cannon fodder.</String>
		<String _locID="40087">I was hoping to capture the first treasure. But I am just as happy that it is you.</String>
		<String _locID="40088">Even lowly wood can be put to use in your war machine.</String>
		<String _locID="40089">Hurrah! I got a free settler!</String>
		<String _locID="40090">Gold here for the taking!</String>
		<String _locID="40091">This New World is a land of plenty, overflowing with food.</String>
		<String _locID="40092">That was a nice bonus for my army.</String>
		<String _locID="40093">I am glad I found this wood before the enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="40094">That is the kind of battle I like! Lots of action and in the end, myself victorious.</String>
		<String _locID="40095">A close-fought struggle but, in the end, my will proved the stronger.</String>
		<String _locID="40096">A balanced fight. Either side could have won, but I did.</String>
		<String _locID="40097">They never had a chance.</String>
		<String _locID="40098">You are skilled at gathering treasures. Keep it up.</String>
		<String _locID="40099">I just rolled right over them. Ha!</String>
		<String _locID="40100">I love it when a battle goes smoothly.</String>
		<String _locID="40101">These walls will stop almost anything!</String>
		<String _locID="40102">Ha! Let the enemy try to come through THESE walls!</String>
		<String _locID="40103">Quickly! We must destroy one of the enemy posts or all is lost!</String>
		<String _locID="40104">Curse their eyes! The enemy has four trading posts. They cannot win by main strength, so they are trying to do so with cunning.</String>
		<String _locID="40105">Building four posts is not the most glorious way to win a war, but it is certainly effective.</String>
		<String _locID="40106">They have to come to us now to keep us from winning. Let us prepare an ambush.</String>
		<String _locID="40107">I see that you have been effective in multiplayer lately! It gives me confidence that we shall conquer today.</String>
		<String _locID="40108">Your multiplayer rating is up from last time we played! It is good to have a competent ally such as yourself.</String>
		<String _locID="40109">Your greed in taking the treasures does my old heart good.</String>
		<String _locID="40110">Hmm. I see by your multiplayer score that you have been having trouble lately. Well, perhaps this fight will turn things around for you.</String>
		<String _locID="40111">Your multiplayer rating makes it clear that you have been suffering defeats. Do not dwell on the past! The future belongs to us!</String>
		<String _locID="40112">I see by the size of your Home City that you have done some growing up! Excellent!</String>
		<String _locID="40113">How strong your Home City looks this time. I am impressed.</String>
		<String _locID="40114">We were here last time. I guess we know the ins and outs of this map by now.</String>
		<String _locID="40115">Don't let me down like you did last time.</String>
		<String _locID="40116">This time for sure! Victory or death!</String>
		<String _locID="40117">Hurrah! It is you again. Last time we won, and that bodes well for this time.</String>
		<String _locID="40118">Thank you for being the backbone of our army last time we were allied. This time I vow to be stronger.</String>
		<String _locID="40119">Do not make me do all the work like last time.</String>
		<String _locID="40120">Do not leave all the work in making discoveries to me. You need to gather your fair share.</String>
		<String _locID="40121">You taught me a hard lesson last game. See how well I've learned from your example.</String>
		<String _locID="40122">Do not worry. I will be just as aggressive on your behalf as I was trying to defeat you.</String>
		<String _locID="40123">Those knaves! Let us seek immediate retribution upon their bodies. They will pay for their insolence!</String>
		<String _locID="40124">The foe may have gotten the first native alliance, but they will not have the last one.</String>
		<String _locID="40125">Why are you just sitting there? The enemy has a native alliance. And we do not!</String>
		<String _locID="40126">Ah, the enemy has a trading post. That should be a juicy nugget for our raiders.</String>
		<String _locID="40127">An enemy trading post? Already? They are more competent that I thought.</String>
		<String _locID="40128">They keep getting more native allies. This gives us more juicy targets to pick from for our attacks.</String>
		<String _locID="40129">Our foe seems very interested in trade. Perhaps that indicates he would lose spirit if we were to strike at them.</String>
		<String _locID="40130">Yes! A neverending stream of native warriors!</String>
		<String _locID="40131">Don't you want some of the treasures too?</String>
		<String _locID="40132">With the wealth we earn from trade we can bury our foes.</String>
		<String _locID="40133">Good, good - now that we have native allies, let us train as many as possible before the enemy does something about it.</String>
		<String _locID="40134">The enemy are slow and weak. That is why we were able to conquer this trade route first.</String>
		<String _locID="40135">The enemy's attempt to defeat us with their puny four of a kind has been crushed under my boot heel.</String>
		<String _locID="40136">With these native warriors I can swamp my foe by sheer numbers.</String>
		<String _locID="40137">Money greases the wheels of warfare. That is what this trading post is for.</String>
		<String _locID="40138">If one native ally is good, more are better!</String>
		<String _locID="40139">If one trading post is good, more are better!</String>
		<String _locID="40140">This fight may be tougher than the last one, but I am tougher, too!</String>
		<String _locID="40141">I see you have decided to face weaker opposition than last time. That is fine - I have nothing against massacres.</String>
		<String _locID="40142">I took this treasure since you had not bothered to do so yourself. Too busy no doubt.</String>
		<String _locID="40143">Only one minute!  Inconceivable! Attack, attack, attack, for we are at the critical moment!</String>
		<String _locID="40144">Ha! We have them by the short hairs now. One minute left before our enemy's total humiliation!</String>
		<String _locID="40145">Just one short minute and the game ends. Our foe is doomed and all because of my... er... I mean "our" power.</String>
		<String _locID="40146">I have crushed our common foe's attempt to subvert the natives.</String>
		<String _locID="40147">What pleasure to see his town crumble as his peasants try hopelessly to flee.</String>
		<String _locID="40148">I love razing towns. It's what I do best.</String>
		<String _locID="40149">I have ruined his trading route.</String>
		<String _locID="40150">My troops have been repulsed by his defenses - temporarily.</String>
		<String _locID="40151">I cannot believe I didn't destroy his native alliance. What has gone wrong?</String>
		<String _locID="40152">His town still stands, but at least we hurt him.</String>
		<String _locID="40153">You did not need this treasure, obviously, since otherwise you would have taken it by now.</String>
		<String _locID="40154">Well, it was only a trading post. Nothing too critical.</String>
		<String _locID="40155">That action is totally impossible.</String>
		<String _locID="40156">Hurry, hurry! Rescue my people here!</String>
		<String _locID="40157">A disaster is in the brewing! We must rush all available troops to this place!</String>
		<String _locID="40158">Do not kill all the enemy before I get there!</String>
		<String _locID="40159">Save some for me!</String>
		<String _locID="40160">I want to kill some of them too! My men are rushing to your side.</String>
		<String _locID="40161">Keep fighting. We are almost there.</String>
		<String _locID="40162">Do not worry about how many men YOU lose. My men will replace your fallen. Just worry about how many of THEM you slay.</String>
		<String _locID="40163">With me by your side, we will drive off the enemy in confusion and defeat.</String>
		<String _locID="40164">I have commanded an attack at this position.</String>
		<String _locID="40165">My explorer will not be useful for a time. When he returns, I shall punish him severely.</String>
		<String _locID="40166">Excellent! A worthy ally. Our foes have no chance.</String>
		<String _locID="40167">In trying to prepare my unstoppable army, I have neglected my economy. I need some coin right now to rectify affairs.</String>
		<String _locID="40168">Quickly, some coin! If it will not cripple you.</String>
		<String _locID="40169">My men cannot fight without food. Do you have any you can lend to me?</String>
		<String _locID="40170">My supply lines are barren of food. I need it badly.</String>
		<String _locID="40171">Without more wood, my progress will stop indefinitely. Do you have some?</String>
		<String _locID="40172">I have a wood shortage. Kindly send some along.</String>
		<String _locID="40173">Sound the war cry! Charge!</String>
		<String _locID="40174">Onward my soldiers! No quarter!</String>
		<String _locID="40175">Death! Death to all who would stand in our way!</String>
		<String _locID="40176">My explorer is incapacitated. Fortunately it is only temporary.</String>
		<String _locID="40177">Your men came in the nick of time.</String>
		<String _locID="40178">Together we put the enemy to flight!</String>
		<String _locID="40179">We teamed up to rout the foe. Now let us take the battle to HIS base.</String>
		<String _locID="40180">So shall all our enemies die!</String>
		<String _locID="40181">Now we have them on the run! Keep attacking!</String>
		<String _locID="40182">Look at them take to their heels! The cowards!</String>
		<String _locID="40183">I know just how to spend this.</String>
		<String _locID="40184">With this shipment, I can prepare a mountain of pain for the enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="40185">My men will eat well tonight.</String>
		<String _locID="40186">I can use this wood for many things -- all of which will harm our foe.</String>
		<String _locID="40187">My explorer has failed us both. He shall pay.</String>
		<String _locID="40188">I hate advising anyone to retreat, but in this case, I think it is the wisest course.</String>
		<String _locID="40189">Save your troops for a fight you can win! This battle is lost.</String>
		<String _locID="40190">You need to send the enemy flying with cannonballs! Roll out the artillery!</String>
		<String _locID="40191">Artillery is the God of war! Forge more cannon!</String>
		<String _locID="40192">Flash your sabers above the foe! Gallop to the charge! You'll need many more horsemen than now.</String>
		<String _locID="40193">The enemy cannot stand up to a charge. Send in the cavalry! Hmm... I see that you need to train and equip some first.</String>
		<String _locID="40194">How can you massacre the enemy with volleys of gunfire or massed bayonet charges if you do not have any infantry?</String>
		<String _locID="40195">Don't you have some kind of building you can use to train infantry? You clearly need far more of them.</String>
		<String _locID="40196">I detest the thought of surrendering to these rascals. Can you see anything else we might try?</String>
		<String _locID="40197">I see no hope ahead, no sun on the horizon. This defeat chokes me like gall, but what else can we do but resign?</String>
		<String _locID="40198">We are doomed. Doomed! Why do you force us to fight on?</String>
		<String _locID="40199">We are going to have peace, even if we have to fight for it.</String>
		<String _locID="40200">Wars never hurt anybody. Except the people who die.</String>
		<String _locID="40201">We train our men not simply to endure battle, but to long for it.</String>
		<String _locID="40202">Chaaaarge!</String>
		<String _locID="40203">Die, poltroon!</String>
		<String _locID="40204">Feel my steel!</String>
		<String _locID="40205">I see I will have to fight all the harder.</String>
		<String _locID="40206">I do not need gold to finish you off.</String>
		<String _locID="40207">Food? I sneer at it. Wood and coin drive my war machine.</String>
		<String _locID="40208">Another warrior for my men to kill.</String>
		<String _locID="40209">Our armies are scattered, our towns destroyed, our hopes dashed. But though no hope is left, we shall never surrender! Never! Do you hear, our enemies? You will have to hunt us down and kill us one by one.</String>
		<String _locID="40210">Wood - what a useless resource.</String>
		<String _locID="40211">See how my population swells?</String>
		<String _locID="40212">This coin is being used to buy powder and shot which will be fired directly at you!</String>
		<String _locID="40213">This food is being used immediately to train soldiers to attack your puny base.</String>
		<String _locID="40214">Free soldiers! The best kind!</String>
		<String _locID="40215">This wood will be used to construct blockhouses to train my army.</String>
		<String _locID="40216">That is the way I like fights. Bloody, straightforward, and ending with me on top.</String>
		<String _locID="40217">You never stood a chance.</String>
		<String _locID="40218">Curse you! I thought I had you that time!</String>
		<String _locID="40219">How did you pull that off? Your army was all but defeated!</String>
		<String _locID="40220">Use this coin to advance our great cause.</String>
		<String _locID="40221">We have not fought for a quite a while. Did it take that long to steel yourself to the task of attempting to defeat me?</String>
		<String _locID="40222">We have not met one another for some time. But it seems from your multiplayer rating that your skills have not improved much.</String>
		<String _locID="40223">Your Home City is a lot bigger than the last time we met. Do not think it will save you.</String>
		<String _locID="40224">I liked this map the last time we played. It's a good map.</String>
		<String _locID="40225">I can defeat you even if you have made the situation more favorable to you than our last encounter.</String>
		<String _locID="40226">You are doomed. You have foolishly made me, your enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="40227">You would settle for the kind of puny victory you get by waiting out a timer? I am almost ashamed to be fighting you.</String>
		<String _locID="40228">You think just because a few ragged native tribes have joined your side you'll be able to field a more effective army? Well... perhaps you are right.</String>
		<String _locID="40229">Your multiplicity of trade routes shows that you waste your time on trivialities. I stick to the essentials.</String>
		<String _locID="40230">Ha! I knew you wouldn't be able to pull it off! Now the REAL fight begins.</String>
		<String _locID="40231">Here is good hearty Russian food to fortify your nation.</String>
		<String _locID="40232">What?! My native allies! You will pay for this!</String>
		<String _locID="40233">How can you fight on when I am able to destroy your town centers as I please?</String>
		<String _locID="40234">Ah, I love the smell of burning trading posts.</String>
		<String _locID="40235">My native warriors can easily trounce yours. Especially since you do not have any yet, you fool.</String>
		<String _locID="40236">This trade route will carry my nation directly to your vulnerable heart.</String>
		<String _locID="40237">Building walls I see. You are wise to fear me.</String>
		<String _locID="40238">A true soldier never walls in.</String>
		<String _locID="40239">You won't hold that native village for long. I will see to that.</String>
		<String _locID="40240">You may have built on the first trade route, but you have not built the last.</String>
		<String _locID="40241">What?! My native allies! You'll pay for this!</String>
		<String _locID="40242">The endless taiga of Russia is filled with trees. Here is wood from it to boost your might.</String>
		<String _locID="40243">I needed that trading post! You will be sorry you attacked it.</String>
		<String _locID="40244">My town! No!</String>
		<String _locID="40245">Too bad. Now I will have to crush you the old-fashioned way.</String>
		<String _locID="40246">By raising the difficulty since last time, you have unleashed powerful Russian forces you did not expect!</String>
		<String _locID="40247">Weakling! I see you needed to play at a feebler difficulty level. This indicates that I should have an easy victory over you.</String>
		<String _locID="40248">Ha ha! The final nails in your coffin are being hammered in right now.</String>
		<String _locID="40249">I have not lost yet!</String>
		<String _locID="40250">It is all over but the victory parade now. Ha!</String>
		<String _locID="40251">Trying to steal my loot, eh? I have taught your thieving troops a lesson.</String>
		<String _locID="40252">Your puny effort to raid my town is futile.</String>
		<String _locID="40253">I will not let the foe destroy this building!</String>
		<String _locID="40254">Your men seem to lack direction. Where are they going?</String>
		<String _locID="40255">Your explorer cannot remain concealed from me!</String>
		<String _locID="40256">It will be a pleasure to crush you beneath my boot heel.</String>
		<String _locID="40257">This kind of a fight suits me just fine. Lots of wild action. Spread death, my men!</String>
		<String _locID="40258">Good, good. Wall in - that will free up extra troops that you can take to the enemy's town.</String>
		<String _locID="40259">Those walls should stop all but the most vigorous enemy assault.</String>
		<String _locID="40260">The British are no better than dead dogs by now.</String>
		<String _locID="40261">The British soldiers are strong... perhaps too strong.</String>
		<String _locID="40262">Soon we will be able to finish off the Netherlands contingent.</String>
		<String _locID="40263">The Dutch fight like demons.</String>
		<String _locID="40264">My men will die rather than let this post fall to the foe.</String>
		<String _locID="40265">The French are helpless before us.</String>
		<String _locID="40266">The French are a dangerous foe. We must be ready for them.</String>
		<String _locID="40267">We Russians have long hated the Germans. It feels good to see them doing down before us.</String>
		<String _locID="40268">We Russians have long hated the Germans. It is like drinking poison to see them doing so well.</String>
		<String _locID="40269">We have almost wiped out the Ottomans. If only getting a warm water port for Holy Mother Russia would be so easy back in Europe.</String>
		<String _locID="40270">We Russians have been fighting the Turks for centuries. Who knows better than us how difficult they are to beat?</String>
		<String _locID="40271">A few more hammerblows and the Portuguese will be out of this game.</String>
		<String _locID="40272">The Portuguese... I had never dreamed that such a small nation could hold such dangerous soldiers.</String>
		<String _locID="40273">Ha! Now we see at last who is the REAL Tsar of all the Russia!</String>
		<String _locID="40274">It is too bad that we are opposed by my brother Russians. It makes the fight less of a massacre than I prefer.</String>
		<String _locID="40275">So bold. But they do not expect me to attack HERE!</String>
		<String _locID="40276">This native village is OURS. I shall keep it for us.</String>
		<String _locID="40277">I knew the Spanish would not prove much of an obstacle.</String>
		<String _locID="40278">The Spanish are so effective on the battlefield. Perhaps we should be focusing better on them.</String>
		<String _locID="40279">The cursed enemy has somehow amassed superior forces! Hurry! Send help!</String>
		<String _locID="40280">Our war is in a downward spiral. Even your strength may not be enough to counteract my weakness.</String>
		<String _locID="40281">The cursed British! Can nothing stop them?</String>
		<String _locID="40282">The enemy advance on every front. But the British foe is not so strong as the rest. Let us destroy him at least.</String>
		<String _locID="40283">Russia is so much vaster than the Netherlands. How can the Dutch be winning?</String>
		<String _locID="40284">If we do nothing, we lose. Let's hit the Dutch hard and fast and see if things look better.</String>
		<String _locID="40285">The French seem everywhere at once. What can I do against such skill?</String>
		<String _locID="40286">We may not win, but let us strike back! The French are our foe's weak spot. Strike!</String>
		<String _locID="40287">My men will garrison this town.</String>
		<String _locID="40288">The Germans. Always invading Russia. Well, Russia may lose this war, but first, let us invade the Germans for a change!</String>
		<String _locID="40289">Blunderer! Knave! Not just your empire, but my own has been destroyed by your clumsiness!</String>
		<String _locID="40290">Resign at once you poltroon! I am better off without your bungling!</String>
		<String _locID="40291">The hated Turks! There are too many of them! At least we can go down fighting.</String>
		<String _locID="40292">The war does not go well, but the Ottomans are not the ones beating us. Let us crush the hated Turks before the end.</String>
		<String _locID="40293">How can a nation as puny as Portugal be so strong in war? It seems inconceivable!</String>
		<String _locID="40294">Portugal is a small nation, and I hope weak. Let us aim our blows at them for now and see where it leads us.</String>
		<String _locID="40295">I should have known better than to take on Russia as my enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="40296">The war does not go well, but at least I have proven stronger than the enemy Russians. Let us at least strike them down before the end.</String>
		<String _locID="40297">This trading post belongs to us, and us alone. I shall not relinquish it to the enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="40298">Spain is far from Russia. I had never encountered them before, and neither had my troops. I am dismayed by their prowess.</String>
		<String _locID="40299">I do not like the way this is going. But... perhaps there is hope if only we can destroy the Spanish. They seem vulnerable.</String>
		<String _locID="40300">We should have crushed them sooner. Now they have called on their friends for help.</String>
		<String _locID="40301">Yet another army?! This may be too much for even me to handle.</String>
		<String _locID="40302">Now that your men fight alongside mine, we can turn the battle's tide and crush the foeman beneath our boot heel!</String>
		<String _locID="40303">Excellent! Now that our armies have joined up, the enemy has no chance here.</String>
		<String _locID="40304">Hurrah! The enemy is in retreat. Now we shall strike while the iron is hot!</String>
		<String _locID="40305">Now we have them where we want them! Attack, attack, attack!</String>
		<String _locID="40306">Now we have the power to win this war! No mercy!</String>
		<String _locID="40307">We still have the edge in this war. No thanks to you.</String>
		<String _locID="40308">I can send coin to you for as long as you need it.</String>
		<String _locID="40309">Must I do everything myself? I have practically won this war alone. Come now, turn things around!</String>
		<String _locID="40310">I knew I could have crushed them alone, but it would have been much easier if you had helped out more.</String>
		<String _locID="40311">The enemy is crushed, thanks to us. Well... mostly thanks to you.</String>
		<String _locID="40312">Now we have them! Keep up the pressure. I am proud to have you as the stronger ally!</String>
		<String _locID="40313">Together we are taking the war to the enemy. At least I am able to help!</String>
		<String _locID="40314">Ha! I was too strong for you so you had to call for your big brother to come help! Coward!</String>
		<String _locID="40315">What is this? You need help to fight me? Can't do it alone, can you? Chicken!</String>
		<String _locID="40316">Ha! Now together we will crush your puny force!</String>
		<String _locID="40317">You cannot stand against us both. No human could!</String>
		<String _locID="40318">Now THIS is the kind of battle I like! Vast numbers of soldiers, with a variety of commanders, all pushed together into the scrim! Have at you!</String>
		<String _locID="40319">I will keep a stream of rations coming to you as long as you require it.</String>
		<String _locID="40320">I see you have banded together in hopes of forestalling your doom. It will not help you. You see OUR armies have teamed up as well.</String>
		<String _locID="40321">My armies... crushed. My town... a burning ruin. It is hopeless. I must offer my surrender.</String>
		<String _locID="40324">My woodsmen will send lumber so long as you lack it.</String>
		<String _locID="40325">War to the hilt! Let us combine our forces to destroy the enemy here.</String>
		<String _locID="40326">The Russian bear shall hold sway here. And you too, should you accompany me.</String>
		<String _locID="40327">Now is the time to unleash the dogs of war. Onward, soldiers of holy mother Russia!</String>
		<String _locID="40328">Soon I shall hold sway over these natives, instead of our hated foe!</String>
		<String _locID="40329">My explorer has returned! Now the enemy shall pay for his insolence.</String>
		<String _locID="40330">When I wreck this trading post, the enemy will no longer have his native friends to shelter behind.</String>
		<String _locID="40331">Our foe does not deserve the benefits of trade. I shall wreck his post here.</String>
		<String _locID="40332">Cutting off the enemy's resources is as effective as killing his soldiers. I am going to strangle him by destroying this trading post.</String>
		<String _locID="40333">My empire expands. I shall build a forward base of operations at this site.</String>
		<String _locID="40334">I have commanded a base to be made here, to menace the enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="40335">I am creating a town center here.</String>
		<String _locID="40336">My empire will expand by constructing a new town at this place.</String>
		<String _locID="40337">I need more territory under my control. I will construct a town here.</String>
		<String _locID="40338">I am adding these natives to our empire.</String>
		<String _locID="40339">Native soldiers will swell the ranks of my army.</String>
		<String _locID="40340">I want to have natives among my troops.</String>
		<String _locID="40341">I see I need the benefits of trade.</String>
		<String _locID="40342">Gold is as good a weapon as a sword, sometimes.</String>
		<String _locID="40343">By occupying a trading site, I can lure out the enemy's forces.</String>
		<String _locID="40344">I am going to hit them where they are weakest - their settlers!</String>
		<String _locID="40345">Without resources, their army withers on the vine. I am off to kill their settlers!</String>
		<String _locID="40346">The Tsar of all the Russians thanks you for your help in bringing back our explorer.</String>
		<String _locID="40347">I am pleased by your efforts on our behalf.</String>
		<String _locID="40348">I am not ungrateful for your assistance.</String>
		<String _locID="40349">Curse the enemy! He has forced me to ransom my explorer.</String>
		<String _locID="40350">Congratulations in so effectively looting this New World.</String>
		<String _locID="40351">Ah good. You are making fine use of your scouts.</String>
		<String _locID="40352">The only thing worse than sending gold to the enemy is not having my explorer here where I need him.</String>
		<String _locID="40353">The foe's puny efforts to deny us the use of my explorer have utterly failed. He is back.</String>
		<String _locID="40354">As usual, the enemy's plans have been thwarted. My explorer has returned to health.</String>
		<String _locID="40355">Our enemy is trying to get native help. I trust it will avail him nothing.</String>
		<String _locID="40356">Even the natives won't be able to save our foe from his destined doom.</String>
		<String _locID="40357">Look at this! An enemy town, but with no defending army! A meaty prize if you can take it.</String>
		<String _locID="40358">The enemy does not realize we know about this town - it's devoid of protection. Let's burn it to the ground!</String>
		<String _locID="40359">The fool! He has built a town without a barracks! Send in the cavalry!</String>
		<String _locID="40360">No barracks? He cannot produce infantry here! Attack quickly before he realizes his blunder.</String>
		<String _locID="40361">He has no stable in this town. Our artillery can bombard it with impunity!</String>
		<String _locID="40362">This will get its own room in the Tsar's Palace.</String>
		<String _locID="40363">I see he has no stable here. Attack at once with a barrage!</String>
		<String _locID="40364">They have killed my explorer! No mercy for the villain!</String>
		<String _locID="40365">Those knaves have killed my explorer. It is an insult to us both!</String>
		<String _locID="40366">What an offense against nature! Those poltroons have assassinated my explorer!</String>
		<String _locID="40367">This wilderness has killed my explorer!</String>
		<String _locID="40368">What a deadly place this New World can be! It's put paid to my efforts to scout for the time being.</String>
		<String _locID="40369">My explorer! No!</String>
		<String _locID="40370">You cannot defeat me alone, so you seek native allies? They will do you no good in the end.</String>
		<String _locID="40371">This town is a ripe plum for the taking.</String>
		<String _locID="40372">Now I know where you are hiding. Your town shall be my prey.</String>
		<String _locID="40373">See what I have found?</String>
		<String _locID="40374">Could you not see how near your ally was? You built practically on his doorstep, leaving the entire rest of the map for me to exploit!</String>
		<String _locID="40375">You are doing so well, my friend. Perhaps this means you can spare a few resources for me to Age up as well?</String>
		<String _locID="40376">Now that you have access to more powerful troops, my role must temporarily be that of support.</String>
		<String _locID="40377">Hmm. I will not be able to Age up as quickly as you have done.</String>
		<String _locID="40378">You are still in the previous Age? I hope you know what you are about.</String>
		<String _locID="40379">Hurry and Age up! You need to catch up to me.</String>
		<String _locID="40380">A fine job of advancement. Do not forget you will need troops to go along with your new upgrades and researches.</String>
		<String _locID="40381">Leaping up in Age! Good, good. Put your technological edge to good use.</String>
		<String _locID="40382">At last! We will not have to endure the contempt of our foes any longer.</String>
		<String _locID="40383">I trust that means you have a huge army waiting somewhere.</String>
		<String _locID="40384">I am gaining wealth for both of us.</String>
		<String _locID="40385">Do you need some kind of help?</String>
		<String _locID="40386">What is the problem? You cannot build a good army in the Discovery Age!</String>
		<String _locID="40387">I see you're still in the previous Age from me. Have you even discovered gunpowder yet?</String>
		<String _locID="40388">Speed in advancement will not matter in the long run.</String>
		<String _locID="40389">Now you can train a few troops before I devastate your countryside.</String>
		<String _locID="40390">It is astounding that anyone could advance through the Ages so slowly!</String>
		<String _locID="40391">Your luck will not hold. Yes, you have acquired the first treasure, but the bulk of the rest will fall to me.</String>
		<String _locID="40392">Pick up treasures while you can. When my soldiers march into your town, it will be too late.</String>
		<String _locID="40393">I have vastly more loot than you. My army and economy will also be vaster than yours.</String>
		<String _locID="40394">Your town is so feeble, you cannot even stop me from looting nearby treasure.</String>
		<String _locID="40395">Well my little upstart, I can't buy our way out of this one.</String>
		<String _locID="40396">Well my little upstart, stick with me and do as I do. Successes like these will become old-hat.</String>
		<String _locID="40397">Splurge a little on some cannon and you'll see much better results on the battlefield.</String>
		<String _locID="40398">The power and speed of horses on the battlefield is an amazing thing, you should try using it.</String>
		<String _locID="40399">Many military conflicts are won by infantry might. If you build some more you might witness this first hand.</String>
		<String _locID="40400">Ah my little upstart, you stand to lose more than you can handle</String>
		<String _locID="40401">Ah my little upstart, you stand to lose more than you will gain if you pursue that fight.</String>
		<String _locID="40402">If we win this conflict our enemies will surely recognize our power.</String>
		<String _locID="40403">Did your scouts not warn you of the strength of my forces? Well now you know to retreat when next we meet.</String>
		<String _locID="40404">My prowess on the battlefield is unmatched, it would be wise of you to respect it.</String>
		<String _locID="40405">Ah, my little upstart, throwing your troops into the mouth of a lion only feeds it and makes it stronger.</String>
		<String _locID="40406">As you can see, I did not become the leader of a strong nation without a strong military.</String>
		<String _locID="40407">My little upstart, soon you will learn true power is earned not imagined.</String>
		<String _locID="40408">Another victory for our side, soon this conflict will be over with.</String>
		<String _locID="40409">If you keep following my lead your nation may become as strong as mine.</String>
		<String _locID="40410">With some money in their pockets and a will to survive my soldiers can make miracles happen.</String>
		<String _locID="40411">I knew if I lost that battle you would lose hope my little upstart. So I turned the tide and won it for you.</String>
		<String _locID="40412">Ha-ha! Victory out of defeat.</String>
		<String _locID="40413">Continue with your build up my little upstart, I have this situation well under control.</String>
		<String _locID="40414">My forces are well paid and well trained, this battle should be short and favor my side.</String>
		<String _locID="40415">I thought about retreating to your forces before this battle but...</String>
		<String _locID="40416">Ah my little upstart, I believe you may have turned this battle in our favor.</String>
		<String _locID="40417">This battle was mine to lose and with the reinforcements the enemy is bringing it looks like I shall.</String>
		<String _locID="40418">But of course.</String>
		<String _locID="40419">It shall be done.</String>
		<String _locID="40420">Right away.</String>
		<String _locID="40421">Very well, I shall use my wealth to purchase many large guns.</String>
		<String _locID="40422">The battlefield will be filled with my artillery and cavalry.</String>
		<String _locID="40423">The battlefield will be filled with my artillery and infantry.</String>
		<String _locID="40424">I know the abilities of cavalry well, I shall train many.</String>
		<String _locID="40425">Yes, cavalry backed by artillery, two very expensive units, but I can certainly afford them both.</String>
		<String _locID="40426">Cavalry followed by foot soldiers, I will begin training my force now.</String>
		<String _locID="40427">I shall use all my resources to mass an army of foot soldiers.</String>
		<String _locID="40428">I will soon have an army of infantry with some artillery mixed in for good measure.</String>
		<String _locID="40429">I will build a large infantry force and protect its flanks with smaller groups of cavalry.</String>
		<String _locID="40430">The wealth of my nation is being used in other ways, for now.</String>
		<String _locID="40431">I regret to inform you that I can not comply</String>
		<String _locID="40432">I must respectfully decline.</String>
		<String _locID="40433">I can not do as you ask for the time being.</String>
		<String _locID="40434">I know you are accustomed to seeing my great armies wielding their power on the field. But at this moment I have none.</String>
		<String _locID="40435">I am prohibited from doing such things.</String>
		<String _locID="40436">I do not have sufficient troops for that task.</String>
		<String _locID="40437">A minor setback; we will still be victorious in the end.</String>
		<String _locID="40438">The British are poor and weak, they should not be a threat for much longer.</String>
		<String _locID="40439">Rebels!! Their challenge to my Dutch rule shall be over soon.</String>
		<String _locID="40440">I believe the French will be nothing but a memory soon.</String>
		<String _locID="40441">I would have never thought the Germans would resign so easily but I think they will be forced to soon.</String>
		<String _locID="40442">The Ottomans are a worthy adversary but I think their days are numbered.</String>
		<String _locID="40443">I sense the Portuguese will not last much longer.</String>
		<String _locID="40444">I fear these nearby trees more than I fear those Russians.</String>
		<String _locID="40445">The Spanish don't pose much of a threat anymore they should resign soon.</String>
		<String _locID="40446">The British are a force to be reckoned with, I nominate you to do the reckoning.</String>
		<String _locID="40447">As usual the Dutch are wealthy and near unbeatable.</String>
		<String _locID="40448">We should make for the French or they might just ride right over us.</String>
		<String _locID="40449">The German army is a well oiled machine, it would be wise to fear them.</String>
		<String _locID="40450">As it stands right now the Ottomans may overpower us.</String>
		<String _locID="40451">I do not want to believe it but the Portuguese are a worthy opponent here in the New World.</String>
		<String _locID="40452">It seems the Russian forces are as fierce as their winters.</String>
		<String _locID="40453">The Spanish power may be unmatched in the New World, we will need to work together to defeat them.</String>
		<String _locID="40454">It seems your wealth and knowledge have surpassed mine would you mind sharing some of your good fortune?</String>
		<String _locID="40455">Ah my little upstart, I hope you haven't rushed up the Age too soon, it will be some time before my technology matches yours.</String>
		<String _locID="40456">I don't know how you advanced so soon but I hope you're full of surprises as good as this one.</String>
		<String _locID="40457">The enemy has formed an alliance with the natives here. They will help to defeat our forces.</String>
		<String _locID="40458">A powerful nation has both a strong economy and military but you need to advance an Age to even begin your military production.</String>
		<String _locID="40459">I hope someday soon your nation will match mine in Age advancement.</String>
		<String _locID="40460">Why are you still in that Age? Do you need resources?</String>
		<String _locID="40461">Advance the Age soon, I don't want barbarians for allies.</String>
		<String _locID="40462">Your quick Age advancement should strike some fear into our adversaries.</String>
		<String _locID="40463">Being the first to advance an Age can be very powerful if you use your new researches and units wisely.</String>
		<String _locID="40464">Wow! That was fast. Maybe I should just pay you to fight all my battles for me.</String>
		<String _locID="40465">If you wish to lead a powerful nation you need to keep up with the rest us my little upstart.</String>
		<String _locID="40466">Technology is the way of the future my little upstart, try not to stay in the past so long next time.</String>
		<String _locID="40467">Being last to Age two doesn't prove you're the weakest, but it doesn't disprove it either.</String>
		<String _locID="40468">I owe you a debt of gratitude for rescuing my explorer.</String>
		<String _locID="40469">Thank you for rescuing my explorer. I just can't seem to keep him out of trouble.</String>
		<String _locID="40470">My rescued explorer, myself, my nation, and his family send you many thanks for your efforts.</String>
		<String _locID="40471">I have crushed the bond between our enemy and his former native allies while thwarting attempt at an easy victory.</String>
		<String _locID="40472">The natives will no longer do the bidding of their evil ally.</String>
		<String _locID="40473">I have driven quite a wedge between our enemy and his native ally.</String>
		<String _locID="40474">My little upstart, sometimes you have to take your enemies apart piece by piece or in this case town by town... hahaha</String>
		<String _locID="40475">This town is no more, we should plan our next move.</String>
		<String _locID="40476">They will get no more value from this trade post.</String>
		<String _locID="40477">The enemy barely survived my attacks but in the end their native trade post is still standing.</String>
		<String _locID="40478">That tyrant is more powerful than I thought and yes the enemy town still stands.</String>
		<String _locID="40479">I thought I could destroy our enemies' trade post but their strength was greater than I had anticipated.</String>
		<String _locID="40480">I'm not sure but I think I've lost my explorer. Oh wait! No no, he is dead again.</String>
		<String _locID="40481">My explorer has been killed again, I promise if you rescue him he will be more careful in the future.</String>
		<String _locID="40482">Hey my little upstart, when my explorer is up again could you leave a circle of your troops around him from now on? I'm sure he'll live longer that way.</String>
		<String _locID="40483">I hope the enemy doesn't find my explorer's body or he might think I'm weak for losing units before I even face him.</String>
		<String _locID="40484">My explorer has died, but not by the hand of my enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="40485">Well my little upstart, I blame your lack of tactics for my defeat, I'm ready to resign at any moment.</String>
		<String _locID="40486">Maybe I can pay-off our enemies so they will grant us safe passage home after I offer my surrender.</String>
		<String _locID="40487">I can't deal with this matter on my own please send help.</String>
		<String _locID="40488">Things are getting out of hand in this area, could you come take care of it my little upstart.</String>
		<String _locID="40489">This is getting out of control! I need your troops in my town now!</String>
		<String _locID="40490">The enemy forces in my town are much larger then what I have to defend with. You might consider sending reinforcements.</String>
		<String _locID="40491">In my town, there-are-just-too-many...</String>
		<String _locID="40492">I looked forward to many successes with you as my ally.</String>
		<String _locID="40493">It pleases me to see you are my ally, we should make short work of our enemies.</String>
		<String _locID="40494">Hello my little upstart, stick by me and you'll become more powerful than you can imagine.</String>
		<String _locID="40495">So you believe your skills have improved since last we met. Let's see how you fare this time and then I'll be the judge.</String>
		<String _locID="40496">I'll tone things down a bit and try to be a little less competitive.</String>
		<String _locID="40497">I'm still reeling from when last we met but I'm sure I'll fare much better this time with you as my ally.</String>
		<String _locID="40498">You may have outscored me the last time we met but I will be the dominant player in this match.</String>
		<String _locID="40499">Ah my little upstart, finally came to your senses and joined my side eh?</String>
		<String _locID="40500">The last time we met your score was pretty low. I hope you've improved since then.</String>
		<String _locID="40501">I see you prefer the play style this map offers which is good since I do as well.</String>
		<String _locID="40502">Heed my advice this time my little upstart and we should fare much better.</String>
		<String _locID="40503">Let us make sure our fate in this match is the same as the last one.</String>
		<String _locID="40504">Well I paid the ransom for my explorer, let's hope he stays alive a little longer this time around.</String>
		<String _locID="40505">My explorer must be a spy! He keeps dying in enemy territory forcing me to pay the enemy a hefty ransom to get him back each time.</String>
		<String _locID="40506">This explorer just makes me poor and my enemies richer with each ransom.</String>
		<String _locID="40507">Ha! I was able to rescue my explorer without paying his ransom.</String>
		<String _locID="40508">I've rescued my explorer. Let's see how long he lives.</String>
		<String _locID="40509">Well, it seems our enemy is too poor to maintain an army to defend his town. We should take advantage and strike!</String>
		<String _locID="40510">My scouts tell me the enemy has no barracks in his town, cavalry should ride through it unimpeded.</String>
		<String _locID="40511">Bring the big guns! Our artillery should be safe attacking the enemy's town since he has no Stable.</String>
		<String _locID="40512">A wealthy nation is a strong nation, so here is some coin.</String>
		<String _locID="40513">I assume you will use this food wisely.</String>
		<String _locID="40514">I have all the wood I need right now, I'm sending some of my extra logs.</String>
		<String _locID="40515">The enemy base here makes some of my settlers nervous so I'm going to destroy it.</String>
		<String _locID="40516">My forces are on the move to the enemy base, I shall be declaring a glorious victory in the near future.</String>
		<String _locID="40517">The enemy settlers are making him rich. I plan going to send a small force to take some out.</String>
		<String _locID="40518">You have to hit the heart to kill the beast. I march on the enemy's main town.</String>
		<String _locID="40519">Watch me take the enemy's main town my little upstart. You might learn something.</String>
		<String _locID="40520">The alliance to these natives is a boost to the enemy's forces I can no longer allow him to have.</String>
		<String _locID="40521">This trade post might make the enemy wealthier than me, I must destroy it.</String>
		<String _locID="40522">I see you're in a fight! My troops are on the way.</String>
		<String _locID="40523">Looks like you're doing well over there, but I'm sending my forces in to make sure it stays that way.</String>
		<String _locID="40524">Rest easy my little upstart, my forces are en route to make sure the outcome there is in our favor.</String>
		<String _locID="40525">This will be the location of my next military base.</String>
		<String _locID="40526">My new town will be built in this location.</String>
		<String _locID="40527">I shall form an alliance with these natives to bolster our forces.</String>
		<String _locID="40528">I believe these natives will be very helpful in the future.</String>
		<String _locID="40529">We Dutch are amazing traders, it only makes sense I build a trade post.</String>
		<String _locID="40530">Once I finish this trade post my wealth will grow immensely.</String>
		<String _locID="40531">This building shall not fall!</String>
		<String _locID="40532">This area has too much value, I will not let the enemy take it.</String>
		<String _locID="40533">I can not allow the enemy to break our alliance with those natives, my forces will protect that area.</String>
		<String _locID="40534">My forces will protect this town.</String>
		<String _locID="40535">I will not let the enemy take this trade post.</String>
		<String _locID="40536">Feel good knowing that Dutch coin will continue to flow into your coffers.</String>
		<String _locID="40537">Your people should never go hungry with this food I'm sending you.</String>
		<String _locID="40538">I suspect I'll see a whole new colony soon from the wood I'm sending you.</String>
		<String _locID="40539">Hold on! My troops are on the way.</String>
		<String _locID="40540">I see you're having trouble defending yourself my little upstart. Don't worry my forces are en route.</String>
		<String _locID="40541">I'm ready to send troops there to help turn back the enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="40542">It's been quiet, maybe too quiet.</String>
		<String _locID="40543">Hope all is well over there, all is fine here.</String>
		<String _locID="40544">Did you know my father was called "the Silent"?</String>
		<String _locID="40545">Could you spare some coin? Just this once I promise.</String>
		<String _locID="40546">My people are hungry, do you have some food to spare?</String>
		<String _locID="40547">I need to build a bank or something, could I have some wood?</String>
		<String _locID="40548">I knew the enemy was lost once your forces showed up.</String>
		<String _locID="40549">Our combined forces on the battlefield, is there a better duo?</String>
		<String _locID="40550">Thank you my little upstart, your troops, although not needed, were welcomed for joining my forces in that battle.</String>
		<String _locID="40551">I shall put this coin to good use.</String>
		<String _locID="40552">Your generosity is greatly appreciated.</String>
		<String _locID="40553">My base survives because of you, thank you.</String>
		<String _locID="40554">The goods you sent me will not go to waste.</String>
		<String _locID="40555">This wood will build many great structures in my town.</String>
		<String _locID="40556">Our outcome looks bleak when looking at the strength of the British player.</String>
		<String _locID="40557">If anyone could put us between a rock and  a hard place I should have known it would be the Dutch.</String>
		<String _locID="40558">The French ride all over us as yet we can not stop them.</String>
		<String _locID="40559">The Ottomans are mighty. They will surely be the cause of our demise.</String>
		<String _locID="40560">(Sighs) When did the Portuguese become so tough?</String>
		<String _locID="40561">Seems the Russians are as many and as strong here in the New World as they are back home.</String>
		<String _locID="40562">The Spanish are everywhere. I do not know if we can defeat them.</String>
		<String _locID="40563">All is not lost. The British are barely holding on.</String>
		<String _locID="40564">The situation is not in our favor but the Dutch are conformable.</String>
		<String _locID="40565">We need to turn the tide of this contest but I sense the French are no real threat to us.</String>
		<String _locID="40566">It seems the Germans are lost and sputtering out of control.. Through them we might be able to change our future.</String>
		<String _locID="40567">The enemy seems too strong but I think the Portuguese are their weak link.</String>
		<String _locID="40568">We may be behind right now but the Russians shouldn't last much longer.</String>
		<String _locID="40569">We're not doing so well but the Spanish are doing even worse.</String>
		<String _locID="40570">Please forgive me, I fear I will be the cause of our great alliance not prospering as it should.</String>
		<String _locID="40571">You are the pinnacle of our strength my little upstart. But I'm not sure you'll be enough to get us out of this one.</String>
		<String _locID="40572">Looks like the end is near, I do not think my strength is enough to hold for the both of us.</String>
		<String _locID="40573">I will have to train you to be more my equal so that we may crush our enemies instead of them crushing us.</String>
		<String _locID="40574">Our combined strength is unmatched.</String>
		<String _locID="40575">It seems you're keeping up with me quite well my little upstart. The enemy no longer has the strength to stand up to our power.</String>
		<String _locID="40576">This alliance has brought me great prosperity. You're better than I imagined you could be.</String>
		<String _locID="40577">Looks like I will ride to glory again, on your coattails of course.</String>
		<String _locID="40578">It's okay your nation isn't as strong as mine, I'll take us both to victory.</String>
		<String _locID="40579">Don't worry my little upstart, I'm doing well enough for the both of us.</String>
		<String _locID="40580">This battle is lost, if we resign now perhaps we can fight together another day.</String>
		<String _locID="40581">We fought the good fight but we've been beaten.</String>
		<String _locID="40582">All is lost, let us resign and take them on again.</String>
		<String _locID="40583">We've missed our chance at victory. Let us resign and fight again.</String>
		<String _locID="40584">They have forged the first alliance with the natives here but it will be their last.</String>
		<String _locID="40585">The enemy is looking to increase their wealth by building on a trade site.</String>
		<String _locID="40586">They are forging more native alliances. We might see more native warrior on the field they we can handle.</String>
		<String _locID="40587">They've built another trade post, they must be stopped.</String>
		<String _locID="40588">Good move, your natives will surely help crush our enemies.</String>
		<String _locID="40589">I'm sure the enemy is quite jealous of your new trade post.</String>
		<String _locID="40590">Nice work! That treasure should be helpful.</String>
		<String _locID="40591">Resources and units from treasures are always A nice bonus.</String>
		<String _locID="40592">Extra coin to your coffers. Spend it wisely.</String>
		<String _locID="40593">You should use that food to build more settlers and expand your economy.</String>
		<String _locID="40594">You must be a skillful leader to take such advantage of the treasures around you.</String>
		<String _locID="40595">As long as you put that treasure to good use I won't mind you taking it from my lands.</String>
		<String _locID="40596">Native warriors, a welcome addition to any army.</String>
		<String _locID="40597">Extra settlers should really help to get your economy going.</String>
		<String _locID="40598">Extra wood is never a bad thing to have.</String>
		<String _locID="40599">Having the upper hand with the natives in this region definitely favors our side.</String>
		<String _locID="40600">Having more trade sites helps create a wealthier nation and I believe a wealthy nation is a strong nation.</String>
		<String _locID="40601">Wall defenses should hold the enemy back for a time.</String>
		<String _locID="40602">Are you getting scared my little upstart? Don't fret, my forces will protect you as well.</String>
		<String _locID="40603">It seems our enemy underestimates the power of these natives, but I do not.</String>
		<String _locID="40604">Like a good businessman a leader must look for ways to improve his wealth and that's what this trade post will do for me.</String>
		<String _locID="40605">What's this? My explorer has done something useful. Haha!</String>
		<String _locID="40606">I will use this treasure to strengthen both our nations.</String>
		<String _locID="40607">These treasures are very useful. Do you see some more?</String>
		<String _locID="40608">The rich just keep getting richer.</String>
		<String _locID="40609">This extra food will help feed my nation.</String>
		<String _locID="40610">I have been eyeing this treasure for some time now. Since you didn't take it, I did.</String>
		<String _locID="40611">You should try to find some more treasures. They're really a boost to any nation.</String>
		<String _locID="40612">If you wish to be powerful and wealthy like me, you need to find more treasures my little upstart.</String>
		<String _locID="40613">I shall use this Native warrior to scout and destroy our enemies.</String>
		<String _locID="40614">Maybe I'll use this wood for a market or bank.</String>
		<String _locID="40615">I couldn't let those tyrants have more native alliances in this region than us.</String>
		<String _locID="40616">More trade sites means more wealth, and you know I like being wealthy.</String>
		<String _locID="40617">The enemy forces are making me nervous so I'm putting up some walls so they cannot surprise me.</String>
		<String _locID="40618">Four of a kind! Lets research the victory condition and put an end to this war.</String>
		<String _locID="40619">Are you an imposter? Because your skill rating was much higher the last time we played.</String>
		<String _locID="40620">I see you've been practicing my little upstart. Your skill rating is much higher than I last remember it.</String>
		<String _locID="40621">I see you've gained quite a bit of experience since we played last. I hope your Home City is more powerful to show for it.</String>
		<String _locID="40622">You might defeat me this time but know it won't be easy to do again.</String>
		<String _locID="40623">Only 1 minute until the end. Can you feel the pressure?</String>
		<String _locID="40624">What a glorious fight, many heroes will be born today.</String>
		<String _locID="40625">You should turn and run, this battle does not look good for you.</String>
		<String _locID="40626">Are those the only troops your nation could afford?</String>
		<String _locID="40627">I'm telling you this as an enemy that respects you, you should retreat.</String>
		<String _locID="40628">My ally has come to save me, don't you wish you ran while you had the chance?</String>
		<String _locID="40629">I see you could not face me alone. Obviously begging your ally for assistance.</String>
		<String _locID="40630">Your technological advances will not save you from the wrath of my forces.</String>
		<String _locID="40631">How did you manage to Age up so quickly? You must tell me your secret.</String>
		<String _locID="40632">Those natives will not be enough to stop my forces.</String>
		<String _locID="40633">You have saved yourself the wrath of many native warriors by destroying that trade post.</String>
		<String _locID="40634">My town center is lost but I am not.</String>
		<String _locID="40635">Drat! That trade post was bringing me much wealth.</String>
		<String _locID="40636">Please advance the Age, I don't want to destroy another nation of barbarians.</String>
		<String _locID="40637">Are you aware of my technological advances? Perhaps you should try to catch up.</String>
		<String _locID="40638">Rushing up Age will not guarantee you victory in the end.</String>
		<String _locID="40639">A little slow on your Age advancement I see. Perhaps you need a minute before I attack?</String>
		<String _locID="40640">Your town center is far from your ally. After I destroy this one I'm sure you'll build your next one a lot closer to him.</String>
		<String _locID="40641">Building next to your ally is the best decision you've made all game, my little upstart.</String>
		<String _locID="40642">Did you think I would allow you to win in such a manner?</String>
		<String _locID="40643">Your native alliance was making you too powerful so I ended it for you.</String>
		<String _locID="40644">Your town center is lost. You will be as well if you do not make the smart decision and resign now.</String>
		<String _locID="40645">I know the wealth a trade post can provide, therefore I couldn't allow you to keep yours much longer.</String>
		<String _locID="40646">A fine day for a war is it not?</String>
		<String _locID="40647">If you consider resigning now I might give you 200 gold for your troubles.</String>
		<String _locID="40648">No formal 'hellos' now, I'll make your acquaintance later on the battlefield.</String>
		<String _locID="40649">I respect you challenging yourself by raising the skill level, but I fear the result may not be what you had hoped.</String>
		<String _locID="40650">Playing at a lower skill level this time. Probably a smart choice when facing me.</String>
		<String _locID="40651">I think you feel this map type helps your play, but realize it also helps mine.</String>
		<String _locID="40652">It was wise of you to lessen the odds against you but I do not think you lowered them enough.</String>
		<String _locID="40653">You could not stop me from rescuing my explorer and I can not stop him from destroying your town.</String>
		<String _locID="40654">My explorer is up but don't worry he's not much of a threat.</String>
		<String _locID="40655">I see your forces with an explorer keeping an eye for them. Well done.</String>
		<String _locID="40656">I just wanted you to know that force your explorer is leading round does not scare me.</String>
		<String _locID="40657">I'm warning you now, if those troops with your explorer come any closer to my town I'm going to have to take him out.</String>
		<String _locID="40658">I see some of your units. They look lost. Where is your explorer?</String>
		<String _locID="40659">Those troops look like an easy target for my men to train their skill.</String>
		<String _locID="40660">For the safety of your own men you should keep them in your town and away from my forces.</String>
		<String _locID="40661">It would be unwise of you to attack me with those forces near my base.</String>
		<String _locID="40662">Only the weak prey on defenseless settlers.</String>
		<String _locID="40663">You obviously need to attack settlers because my troops would cut yours to pieces.</String>
		<String _locID="40664">My losses will be dwarfed compared to what I'm about to do to you!</String>
		<String _locID="40665">Wow! That's an impressive force I see.</String>
		<String _locID="40666">Your force is of decent size but I would advise not attacking with it.</String>
		<String _locID="40667">This will not bode well for me.</String>
		<String _locID="40668">Is that what you call a raid??</String>
		<String _locID="40669">I have found your town. Now I know where to strike.</String>
		<String _locID="40670">I have spotted your town and for now, it actually resembles mine in some ways.</String>
		<String _locID="40671">Well my little upstart, if you want that town of yours to survive you should surrender it to me now.</String>
		<String _locID="40672">Its unfortunate that you could not get this treasure because it sure was helpful.</String>
		<String _locID="40673">Ha! My army is on your doorstep!</String>
		<String _locID="40674">I am here and prepared to fight!</String>
		<String _locID="40675">It is time to test your skills my little upstart, my army is upon you!</String>
		<String _locID="40676">I so enjoy having time to build upon my economy.</String>
		<String _locID="40677">I hope you're using this time wisely, my next attack is not too far away.</String>
		<String _locID="40678">What do you do with your nation when I'm not attacking you?</String>
		<String _locID="40679">You have beaten me, and I would like to offer my surrender.</String>
		<String _locID="40680">I sense I can no longer obtain victory, may I resign now?</String>
		<String _locID="40682">Your actions have only delayed the inevitable.</String>
		<String _locID="40683">Nicely done, alliances with natives may be the path to victory in this conflict.</String>
		<String _locID="40684">That trade post will not help you gain more wealth than my banks can produce.</String>
		<String _locID="40686">That is only one treasure, I will find many more than that.</String>
		<String _locID="40687">Do you have the wisdom to use that treasure wisely?</String>
		<String _locID="40688">It is better you got that treasure or I would have too great an advantage over you.</String>
		<String _locID="40689">Hmm, seems your explorer finds useful things to do with his time, unlike mine.</String>
		<String _locID="40690">Will you be able to buy an army to beat me with that little bit of coin?</String>
		<String _locID="40691">A little bit of food, I'm not worried.</String>
		<String _locID="40692">You have an unfair advantage, your explorer is doing something useful.</String>
		<String _locID="40693">I left that treasure there as a trap, now I'm going to hunt your explorer down.</String>
		<String _locID="40694">Natives are good but treasure will not be enough to help you in the end.</String>
		<String _locID="40695">I'm sure I could put those settler to better use in my town.</String>
		<String _locID="40696">That will just give me more building to tear down.</String>
		<String _locID="40697">A wise plan to wall in, but they won't be enough to save you.</String>
		<String _locID="40698">I thought you were not afraid of me when we declared war on each other but these walls make me think differently.</String>
		<String _locID="40699">Be careful, soon native warriors will be attacking your town.</String>
		<String _locID="40700">This trade post will only add to my wealth.</String>
		<String _locID="40701">My explorer must really want to destroy you because he is actually helping to victory.</String>
		<String _locID="40702">I'm sorry but I could not allow you to have this treasure.</String>
		<String _locID="40703">More coin to my coffers!!</String>
		<String _locID="40704">This will help me field an army greater than yours.</String>
		<String _locID="40705">Why do you leave such treasures for me on your lands? I guess you know those lands will belong to me soon enough.</String>
		<String _locID="40706">Is your explorer dead? I haven't seen him.</String>
		<String _locID="40707">You'll see him soon... attacking your town.</String>
		<String _locID="40708">Extra settlers for a wealthy nation, this cannot fare well for you.</String>
		<String _locID="40709">This wood will help me build a barracks or a bank, whichever.</String>
		<String _locID="40710">That alliance won't last long.</String>
		<String _locID="40711">That trade site will help you become almost as wealthy as me.</String>
		<String _locID="40712">Trying to take the easy win condition, eh my little upstart? I'll put an end to this nonsense.</String>
		<String _locID="40713">Take the peaceful way defeat and just allow this timer to run out.</String>
		<String _locID="40714">What happened to your rating? Been facing more leaders like myself?</String>
		<String _locID="40715">I see your rating is going up, are you ready for your next lesson my little upstart?</String>
		<String _locID="40716">I hope all that experience has made your Home City more powerful than the last time we met.</String>
		<String _locID="40718">The enemy will no longer benefit from this native alliance. I am going to destroy their base here.</String>
		<String _locID="40719">I shall comply immediately.</String>
		<String _locID="40720">Well thought out!</String>
		<String _locID="40721">I regret that I am not allowed to take that step.</String>
		<String _locID="40722">It is impossible for me to do as you wish.</String>
		<String _locID="40723">Yes I agree. Artillery backed by cavalry it is.</String>
		<String _locID="40724">You are right. Artillery plus infantry should seal our enemy's fate.</String>
		<String _locID="40725">Artillery is the god of the battlefield, after all.</String>
		<String _locID="40726">The best generals were all artillerymen first.</String>
		<String _locID="40727">My cavalry can run amuck! With some artillery pieces to back them up we shall have a fine army.</String>
		<String _locID="40728">Yes, if I train cavalry - perhaps even cuirassiers - and accompany them with some infantry... we shall see...</String>
		<String _locID="40729">The enemy's control of these natives has been a pain like a boil. I am about to lance it.</String>
		<String _locID="40730">I love infantry. Their stolid relentless nature brings out the best in my artillerymen as well.</String>
		<String _locID="40731">I shall train infantry! The queen of battle! With some horsemen to keep their flanks safe.</String>
		<String _locID="40732">I will train the cavalry component of our joint army.</String>
		<String _locID="40733">I see you have heard the reputation of the French cavalry! Soon they shall fight at your side.</String>
		<String _locID="40734">Infantry has many uses. I shall train as large a force as possible.</String>
		<String _locID="40735">Infantry have staying power that other units lack. I shall field as many as you need.</String>
		<String _locID="40736">Now you have the economic edge over our foe.</String>
		<String _locID="40737">Use the gold wisely.</String>
		<String _locID="40738">An army travels on its stomach. It is good you found food.</String>
		<String _locID="40739">What a creative way to add to your army.</String>
		<String _locID="40740">I am going to deny the enemy this trading site.</String>
		<String _locID="40741">We need wood as much as steel and shot.</String>
		<String _locID="40742">I will take all of these I can get.</String>
		<String _locID="40743">I can use this coin to pay my soldiers.</String>
		<String _locID="40744">Food to feed my soldiers!</String>
		<String _locID="40745">Free soldiers are always good for the soul.</String>
		<String _locID="40746">More wood - more buildings.</String>
		<String _locID="40747">I never doubted my eventual victory in that fight.</String>
		<String _locID="40748">The enemy soldiers gave it their best shot, but it was not enough.</String>
		<String _locID="40749">Did you watch that fight closely? You can learn something from my skill as a commander.</String>
		<String _locID="40750">All too easy.</String>
		<String _locID="40751">No more trade for the enemy here!</String>
		<String _locID="40752">I thought I would win. And I did.</String>
		<String _locID="40753">I wish the enemy would present more of a challenge.</String>
		<String _locID="40754">The best offense is a good defense.</String>
		<String _locID="40755">Walling in my main base will free up more troops for the attack.</String>
		<String _locID="40756">Keep calm. All we have to do is knock out one of the enemy posts and all will be well.</String>
		<String _locID="40757">We need to organize for an assault on one of the four enemy posts as soon as possible.</String>
		<String _locID="40758">We have them by the nape of the neck. If they cannot break through our defenses, they are done for.</String>
		<String _locID="40759">Do not relax your vigilance. The enemy will be desperate now.</String>
		<String _locID="40760">Congratulations are in order, I see. Your multiplayer rating has skyrocketed since we last met.</String>
		<String _locID="40761">How impressive - your multiplayer score is much higher than before.</String>
		<String _locID="40762">This is the most strategic place for me to set up a new base.</String>
		<String _locID="40763">I see your multiplayer score has dropped since our last session. Well, watch what I do and learn.</String>
		<String _locID="40764">Your multiplayer rating is so low! I will try to teach you what I can, but it's up to you to apply it in battle.</String>
		<String _locID="40765">I am happy to see that you have been building your skills and experience since we last met.</String>
		<String _locID="40766">I applaud you for increasing your Home City's size so much since last time.</String>
		<String _locID="40767">Something about this map seems familiar to me.</String>
		<String _locID="40768">Our last fight alongside one another was a bit of a fiasco. I'm sure we will turn it around this time.</String>
		<String _locID="40769">Remember what you did last time we played? We lost. So don't do that same stuff.</String>
		<String _locID="40770">Remember what you did the last time we played? We won. So do the same things!</String>
		<String _locID="40771">I promise to do better than last time.</String>
		<String _locID="40772">Try to improve on your past skills, please.</String>
		<String _locID="40773">The enemy will not like the base I'm going to construct here.</String>
		<String _locID="40774">I went easy on you when we fought each other last time. Now that we are allies, I'm pulling out all the stops.</String>
		<String _locID="40775">So now you seek me as an ally instead of a foeman. That is wise.</String>
		<String _locID="40776">This is quite irksome. I guess we will have to seek victory the old-fashioned way.</String>
		<String _locID="40777">Even though the enemy has already allied with the natives, we still have a little time before he can make that alliance effective. We must move quickly and decisively.</String>
		<String _locID="40778">The enemy now has natives, unlike us. We can only hope that this alliance has overstretched them.</String>
		<String _locID="40779">The enemy now has a trading post. I trust this means they will be emphasizing their shopkeepers instead of their military.</String>
		<String _locID="40780">The enemy may have overstretched their resources, building that trading post so soon.</String>
		<String _locID="40781">Though the enemy has more native villages on his side, we should be able to keep up with his numbers by diligently training our troops.</String>
		<String _locID="40782">Why is our enemy building so many trading posts? What are they thinking?</String>
		<String _locID="40783">With these extra natives, we can outfight and outtrain our enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="40784">Here is my next town center.</String>
		<String _locID="40785">More trading posts means more money, which can be turned into a bigger army.</String>
		<String _locID="40786">We have natives now. And the enemy does not!</String>
		<String _locID="40787">I am glad to see you are keeping an eye on the trading post sites.</String>
		<String _locID="40788">Well, I have stopped their victory countdown. Now they will probably resort to other means.</String>
		<String _locID="40789">As expected, I have claimed the first native village.</String>
		<String _locID="40790">It is only logical that I should claim a trade route first.</String>
		<String _locID="40792">Every trading post we build brings us closer to economic triumph.</String>
		<String _locID="40793">I do not fear the outcome of this fight. Even at a higher difficulty level than our last combat, we should win.</String>
		<String _locID="40794">We do not have much of a challenge ahead of us, now that you've turned down the difficulty.</String>
		<String _locID="40795">Now I shall annex this land here.</String>
		<String _locID="40796">There is no time to waste! Throw everything you have at the enemy trading posts or we are done for!</String>
		<String _locID="40797">Victory is all but assured now. They have but one minute to stop us, and I do not think they can do it.</String>
		<String _locID="40798">A single minute. Then the laurels of victory will be ours.</String>
		<String _locID="40799">There is no hope for us now, my friend. I have let you down. Let us surrender while we still have a little dignity.</String>
		<String _locID="40800">These natives will no longer serve the purposes of our enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="40801">That is the end of that town. Let us move on to the next.</String>
		<String _locID="40802">He no longer has the use of that town. It is in our hands.</String>
		<String _locID="40803">Now that we have captured this area, should we build our own trading site here?</String>
		<String _locID="40804">That base was too well-fortified. We will need a stronger army.</String>
		<String _locID="40805">That village was surprisingly difficult to take down.</String>
		<String _locID="40806">This area is rich in resources and tactically vital. I will take it.</String>
		<String _locID="40807">His town has foiled us. For now.</String>
		<String _locID="40808">We must try harder in the future. That trading post further strengthens our opponent every minute.</String>
		<String _locID="40809">Why do you fight on? The case is hopeless. If you do not surrender soon, I may do so on my own.</String>
		<String _locID="40810">Coin - your war chest can use this, can it not?</String>
		<String _locID="40811">The French have the finest cuisine in the world my friend. Take these rations and see for yourself.</String>
		<String _locID="40812">Wood may not be as exciting as coin or food, but it is still necessary. Take this for your coffers.</String>
		<String _locID="40813">I cannot do as you request.</String>
		<String _locID="40814">The critical place we must help is this spot, here.</String>
		<String _locID="40815">I need your assistance - kindly send troops to this point as soon as possible.</String>
		<String _locID="40816">My soldiers are already en route.</String>
		<String _locID="40817">The natives here are going to assist us.</String>
		<String _locID="40818">I am going to reinforce you here.</String>
		<String _locID="40819">In my opinion we need more men here. I am sending them right now.</String>
		<String _locID="40820">I will be there as soon as possible.</String>
		<String _locID="40821">You will not lose here. I have sent a corps to back you up.</String>
		<String _locID="40822">Keep it up. Soon my men will arrive and the jaws of the trap will close on the enemy army.</String>
		<String _locID="40823">I have assigned a sufficient force to defend this building.</String>
		<String _locID="40824">None shall pass.</String>
		<String _locID="40825">I will keep this native village out of the enemy's hands.</String>
		<String _locID="40826">The enemy should not take this town. I will guard it.</String>
		<String _locID="40827">This would be a dangerous spot for the enemy to build on. I will protect it.</String>
		<String _locID="40828">What?! How can this be? I can't fight on without troops or resources! I tender my resignation to you.</String>
		<String _locID="40829">I have fought the natives before, and they were redoubtable enemies. They will be equally redoubtable friends.</String>
		<String _locID="40830">Tell me when you no longer need the extra coin, and I will stop sending it.</String>
		<String _locID="40831">Ah, food cooked by French chefs. Tell me when you need no more.</String>
		<String _locID="40832">Let me know when I have sent enough wood to you.</String>
		<String _locID="40833">I am pleased to have an ally worthy of my prowess.</String>
		<String _locID="40834">I need some coin right now. I vow it will go to good use.</String>
		<String _locID="40835">Please send me some coin if at all possible.</String>
		<String _locID="40836">I need food badly.</String>
		<String _locID="40837">An army travels on its stomach. Can you ship me some food?</String>
		<String _locID="40838">Without wood, how can I build an empire? Do you have some wood you're not using?</String>
		<String _locID="40839">Ship me some wood. Now. Er... please?</String>
		<String _locID="40840">I will form a French/Indian alliance.</String>
		<String _locID="40841">They are doomed. Already I can taste victory.</String>
		<String _locID="40842">Their soldiers are too few, and too badly managed. I sense victory.</String>
		<String _locID="40843">See how the enemy line is already beginning to crack under my troops' hammerblows.</String>
		<String _locID="40844">I could have done it without your assistance, but you did save me some time.</String>
		<String _locID="40845">Working together we were able to save my base.</String>
		<String _locID="40846">Perhaps I could have saved my base alone. We shall never know.</String>
		<String _locID="40847">A few more victories like this, and our foe will be undone.</String>
		<String _locID="40848">This is just the way I won the battle of Austerlitz.</String>
		<String _locID="40849">Let us take a brief breather, and return to the fray once more.</String>
		<String _locID="40850">This coin will be put to good use.</String>
		<String _locID="40851">A trading post can be as strong a weapon as a fortress.</String>
		<String _locID="40852">This is just what I needed.</String>
		<String _locID="40853">This food is almost as good as my own chefs could cook.</String>
		<String _locID="40854">This wood comes at a most opportune time.</String>
		<String _locID="40855">You must be able to recognize a defeat well ahead of time, so that you can keep it as minimal as possible.</String>
		<String _locID="40856">Pull back at once! The enemy is too strong here.</String>
		<String _locID="40858">With artillery, war is made. You have a lack of these basic means, my ally.</String>
		<String _locID="40859">Cavalry is the answer to our problems. Equip some horsemen and we can ride down the enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="40860">Your army is unbalanced. You need more horsemen to balance the rest of your forces.</String>
		<String _locID="40861">Infantry is the queen of battle. You have too many kings and not enough queens.</String>
		<String _locID="40862">Trade brings wealth, and wealth: power.</String>
		<String _locID="40863">Infantry is the backbone of any army. Your army, my friend, is practically spineless by comparison.</String>
		<String _locID="40864">The situation does not look good, my friend. Perhaps we should make a dignified retreat and resign this game.</String>
		<String _locID="40865">This time they have proven the stronger force. Perhaps we will defeat them next time. Shall we resign now?</String>
		<String _locID="40866">A soldier will fight long and hard for a bit of colored ribbon.</String>
		<String _locID="40867">You know - a throne is only a bench covered with velvet.</String>
		<String _locID="40868">Death is nothing - to live defeated is to die daily.</String>
		<String _locID="40869">Attack! Down with you, vile enemy!</String>
		<String _locID="40870">Now you should begin to understand just how badly you have blundered.</String>
		<String _locID="40871">Your men are doomed.</String>
		<String _locID="40872">Can't you train your own?</String>
		<String _locID="40873">I need money to expand my economy. Trade will do the trick.</String>
		<String _locID="40874">Hard up for gold?</String>
		<String _locID="40875">Are your folks starving, that you would waste time looting that?</String>
		<String _locID="40876">Can't train your own soldiers, so you recruit them from the wilderness?</String>
		<String _locID="40877">Wood is in the trees, not laying around the ground.</String>
		<String _locID="40878">More settlers means a bigger economy which means a stronger army. Too bad for you.</String>
		<String _locID="40879">Wealth is the blood of nations.</String>
		<String _locID="40880">More rations for my ever-growing forces.</String>
		<String _locID="40881">More warriors for my army! And free ones at that!</String>
		<String _locID="40882">Wood is good for natives, artillery, and necessary buildings. Free wood is best.</String>
		<String _locID="40883">Can't you put up a better fight?</String>
		<String _locID="40884">I go now to raid their settlers.</String>
		<String _locID="40885">That battle was rather... trivial. I kept hoping you had an interesting surprise up your sleeve. But no.</String>
		<String _locID="40886">Is that it? I guess it was too much to expect you to pull off a win with those odds against you.</String>
		<String _locID="40887">This war might be more interesting than I had predicted.</String>
		<String _locID="40888">Nice job. I'll have to change my strategy I see.</String>
		<String _locID="40889">Your multiplayer rating is much higher. I hope this means you will present an interesting challenge for me.</String>
		<String _locID="40890">I see your multiplayer rating has plummeted since our last encounter. Well, watch carefully what I do and perhaps you'll learn something.</String>
		<String _locID="40891">I've been idle for so long. Thanks for letting me have another chance to meet you.</String>
		<String _locID="40892">Are you in a rut? This is the same kind of countryside as the last time we played!</String>
		<String _locID="40893">This is going to be harder for me than the last time we met.</String>
		<String _locID="40894">I respect an opponent who's willing to take on a tougher challenge than he did last game. My hat is off to you.</String>
		<String _locID="40895">I am going to kill off some enemy settlers to slow their economy's growth.</String>
		<String _locID="40896">Cunning of you to use map control and four trading posts to try for a victory. It won't work, however.</String>
		<String _locID="40897">You may have access to more native warriors for now, but soon the situation will be altered in my favor.</String>
		<String _locID="40898">Now that my explorer has been rescued, his labors will benefit us both.</String>
		<String _locID="40899">You have spread yourself thin on the trade routes. I can take keen advantage of this.</String>
		<String _locID="40900">The problem: too many enemy trading posts. The solution: elimination. Problem solved.</String>
		<String _locID="40901">The natives don't want your burdensome rule. They'll be much better off under MY burdensome rule.</String>
		<String _locID="40902">This is a decisive blow at your very heart!</String>
		<String _locID="40903">This time your trading post - next time your whole empire!</String>
		<String _locID="40904">With these native warriors assisting me, I can swamp you with numbers.</String>
		<String _locID="40905">You are remiss, my friend. This trading post will boost my power and lead to my ultimate win.</String>
		<String _locID="40906">I suppose those walls might delay the inevitable for a few short minutes.</String>
		<String _locID="40907">The money you're wasting on those walls would have been better used to beef up your army.</String>
		<String _locID="40908">Excellent! You have saved us from the cost of a ransom.</String>
		<String _locID="40909">I had marked those natives as MY allies. I must do something about the situation.</String>
		<String _locID="40910">I think by building that trading post, you have stretched your resources just a little too far.</String>
		<String _locID="40911">I did not need that particular native alliance anyway.</String>
		<String _locID="40912">It is most annoying, but I can survive without that trading post. For now.</String>
		<String _locID="40913">You think this will stop me? It just steels my resolve.</String>
		<String _locID="40914">Don't think this ends the threat to you.</String>
		<String _locID="40915">Of course I always fight to the best of my ability. But now that you have increased the difficulty, my ability has risen accordingly. Beware!</String>
		<String _locID="40916">Couldn't take the higher difficulties, eh? Decided to turn it down a notch?</String>
		<String _locID="40917">Now the burden for action is on your shoulders. All I have to do is keep a firm grip on my trading posts and it's all over.</String>
		<String _locID="40918">Just one... wait! Surely you don't want it to end this way? Demolish one of your trading posts, quickly! Let us end this with a bang, not a whimper.</String>
		<String _locID="40919">Aha! Thanks to you, my explorer is back in action.</String>
		<String _locID="40920">You fools. You thought you could defeat me. Now I am only seconds from winning.</String>
		<String _locID="40921">Even over something as trivial as that treasure, I am able to give your soldiers a sound drubbing.</String>
		<String _locID="40922">You'll need more soldiers than that to attack MY town.</String>
		<String _locID="40923">Your troops are out in the open. Exposed.</String>
		<String _locID="40924">Now that I can see where your explorer is headed, I know your entire plan.</String>
		<String _locID="40925">You stand no chance against my skilled legions. Surrender now.</String>
		<String _locID="40926">This fight is going to be complicated. That will give me a natural advantage.</String>
		<String _locID="40927">Sometimes it is good to look to our defenses, such as walls.</String>
		<String _locID="40928">I see you have walled off your base. I considered it myself.</String>
		<String _locID="40929">Ha ha! Perfidious Albion will soon be no more!</String>
		<String _locID="40930">I'm sure I'd be able to conquer you if we only fought a little longer. But in the interest of saving time I hereby offer to quit in your favor. Is that acceptable?</String>
		<String _locID="40931">Alas! I need my explorer and we could not rescue him, so I paid a hefty ransom. At least he is back now.</String>
		<String _locID="40932">Those cursed Beefeaters are proving difficult for our troops to overcome. Will it be another Waterloo?</String>
		<String _locID="40933">I never did think the Dutch would offer much of a threat.</String>
		<String _locID="40934">The wealth and power of the Dutch are giving them disproportionate strength.</String>
		<String _locID="40935">Tres bien! We now know who is best suited to rule the French nation!</String>
		<String _locID="40936">The enemy French are nearly as strong as mine. This could be a problem, my friend.</String>
		<String _locID="40937">Germany was my battlefield and playground for many a year. History repeats itself.</String>
		<String _locID="40938">These Germans seem strangely effective in combat. Too effective.</String>
		<String _locID="40939">One Turk can beat three Frenchmen. But ten Frenchmen are a match for ten Turks. And one hundred Frenchmen can defeat any number of Turks.</String>
		<String _locID="40940">The Ottomans have always been a powerful enemy. One-for-one they may be the strongest soldiers in Europe!</String>
		<String _locID="40941">So much for the vaunted Portuguese. I had wondered what they would be like to fight. Mere pushovers.</String>
		<String _locID="40942">I had to pay through the nose to get my explorer back. If only we could have rescued him.</String>
		<String _locID="40943">The Portuguese are proving stalwart opponents. There must be something we can do about them.</String>
		<String _locID="40944">The Russians are almost gone. I wish I had you by my side when I marched on Moscow in 1812, my friend.</String>
		<String _locID="40945">The Russians are proving as stubborn here in the New World as they did in the Old.</String>
		<String _locID="40946">The Spanish never could stand up to good French firepower.</String>
		<String _locID="40947">Spain proved an annoying problem to me in 1807-1814. History seems to be repeating itself.</String>
		<String _locID="40948">The enemy is too strong for me at this time. Please send help at once.</String>
		<String _locID="40949">They have somehow overcome my forces. My weakness may now prove your Achilles heel.</String>
		<String _locID="40950">I fear I have met another Waterloo at the hands of the hated British.</String>
		<String _locID="40951">The enemy has us on the defensive. Perhaps we can at least destroy the perfidious British?</String>
		<String _locID="40952">I wish the Dutch had been on our side, instead of opposed to us.</String>
		<String _locID="40953">Bravo! My men have rescued my explorer.</String>
		<String _locID="40954">My advice is for us to try to take out the Dutch player. Annihilate him, and we could turn this war around.</String>
		<String _locID="40955">The French are, as always, redoubtable. In fact, I think they have beaten me soundly.</String>
		<String _locID="40956">I no longer have confidence in our ultimate victory. But for now, the enemy French are vulnerable to a counterattack.</String>
		<String _locID="40957">I do not like our prospects. But I think the Germans are the enemy's weak point.</String>
		<String _locID="40958">You have betrayed our cause. I would have won if you had not dragged me down with your floundering!</String>
		<String _locID="40959">So your ineptitude has brought me to this pass. Now it looks as though we might lose.</String>
		<String _locID="40960">The Ottomans are so numerous and so wealthy that I see nothing we can do to turn the tide.</String>
		<String _locID="40961">The Turkish empire is tottering. Let us take them down with us!</String>
		<String _locID="40962">The Portuguese have long been my enemies. It seems I cannot hold them off much longer.</String>
		<String _locID="40963">My explorer is back on his feet and ready for action.</String>
		<String _locID="40964">The Portuguese have long been my enemies. Before we give up, let's strike at them - they may prove to be the weak point in our opponents' defenses.</String>
		<String _locID="40965">The Russians are stronger than we. History repeats itself.</String>
		<String _locID="40966">I perceive a weakness in the Russian foe. We may possibly be able to get out of our predicament by focusing on them and knocking them out of the war.</String>
		<String _locID="40967">I am stunned that the Spanish, of all people, are proving the masters.</String>
		<String _locID="40968">The weak opposing Spanish are like an ulcer in our enemy's side. Let us take advantage of their feebleness and destroy them. We may yet win this war.</String>
		<String _locID="40969">We did not defeat them quickly enough. We gave them time to summon reinforcements and that could be our undoing.</String>
		<String _locID="40970">We had the victory won, but now there are more of them. Do you have any reserves you could send?</String>
		<String _locID="40971">It is good that your troops have come to help mine. A little longer and who knows what could have happened? I might even have lost!</String>
		<String _locID="40972">I was worried about the outcome of this fight, but your men seem to have come in time to save my forces! Merci, my friend.</String>
		<String _locID="40973">As I predicted, we are masters in this struggle.</String>
		<String _locID="40975">The enemy has not proven able to cope with us. Now our combined forces will finish him off.</String>
		<String _locID="40976">The enemy's incompetence has led him to this pass. We need only to keep doing what we have been doing so far to let victory fall into our hands.</String>
		<String _locID="40977">The enemy is falling behind me. I wish you would catch up.</String>
		<String _locID="40978">I realize that I could have beaten the enemy by myself, but still there was no need to put it to the test.</String>
		<String _locID="40979">There is still time for you to rally your forces and participate in the final crushing of the foe. Surely you don't want me to have ALL the glory?</String>
		<String _locID="40980">You are doing a terrific job, my friend. I shall strive to live up to your example.</String>
		<String _locID="40981">Move onward to victory! I shall assist you as much as possible!</String>
		<String _locID="40982">Your powerful army and economy have led our alliance to the verge of victory. You are a great leader.</String>
		<String _locID="40983">I had you in the grasp of my hand. Do not think that just because your ally managed to save you THIS time that he will be able to do it EVERY time.</String>
		<String _locID="40984">Seeking refuge under your ally's protective cloak? That won't work forever, you know.</String>
		<String _locID="40985">Hmm. The enemy now has native allies. We shall have to fight all the harder.</String>
		<String _locID="40986">We need to fight natives as well as our main enemy. Keep training that army of yours!</String>
		<String _locID="40987">You clearly do not comprehend the value of combining your forces, and it's going to cost you this fight.</String>
		<String _locID="40988">I could have defeated you alone, but my ally wished to join in the spoils. Too bad for you.</String>
		<String _locID="40989">The fact you have joined up will help you no more than it helped my enemies at Austerlitz. And even better than at Austerlitz, now I have allied troops assisting me.</String>
		<String _locID="40990">You have fallen into our trap! Your armies, grouped together, will now be shattered by OUR armies, grouped together. This will be one of my most glorious triumphs!</String>
		<String _locID="40991">The fools! This enemy town is completely defenseless! Let us take advantage!</String>
		<String _locID="40992">Strike quickly before the enemy realize how vulnerable this town is!</String>
		<String _locID="40993">Our enemy has stuck his neck out - here is a town with no barracks. Send in the cavalry!</String>
		<String _locID="40994">I shall start an offensive at this point.</String>
		<String _locID="40995">He can't reinforce this town with infantry. Take advantage of it!</String>
		<String _locID="40996">Attacking this town with artillery would be easy. He has no stable to produce cavalry.</String>
		<String _locID="40997">I wonder why he has not built a stable near here? Let us take advantage of his oversight at once.</String>
		<String _locID="40998">The enemy has killed my explorer. Perhaps a quick patrol could catch and kill the troops that did this.</String>
		<String _locID="40999">My explorer was overbold and has paid the price.</String>
		<String _locID="41000">My explorer has been slain. Yours must do double duty from now on.</String>
		<String _locID="41002">My explorer lies bleeding his life out, and he was not even taken down by the enemy!</String>
		<String _locID="41003">Now my explorer is hors de combat. This is not an auspicious beginning.</String>
		<String _locID="41004">How pitiable... calling upon the natives of this land for help.</String>
		<String _locID="41005">The French need this area. So we shall take it.</String>
		<String _locID="41006">This is a terrible place to build a town, as I will soon demonstrate.</String>
		<String _locID="41007">My brilliant scouting techniques have spotted your town's center. Soon the invasion shall begin.</String>
		<String _locID="41008">Towns so near to each other mean you will eat up all the nearby resources all the sooner.</String>
		<String _locID="41009">Your skill in managing your town impresses me. I hope you have not done so too soon.</String>
		<String _locID="41010">You advance with breakneck speed I see. That should give us a tactical edge on our common enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="41011">Excellent, now that you have the technological edge, press your advantage!</String>
		<String _locID="41012">Every time you get a treasure like that, it is good for both of us.</String>
		<String _locID="41013">What do you think you're doing? Shouldn't you be an Age or two higher by now?</String>
		<String _locID="41014">I have been in the next Age for what seems like hours. When will you follow suit?</String>
		<String _locID="41015">When I capture this base, it will unravel the enemy's position.</String>
		<String _locID="41016">I see you run your economy effectively. I am confident you will prove as good at warfare, no?</String>
		<String _locID="41017">That was fast! I suspect it bodes well for the future of our alliance.</String>
		<String _locID="41018">It's about time you managed to reach the Commerce Age with the rest of us.</String>
		<String _locID="41019">Finally!</String>
		<String _locID="41020">I see your colony is still in the early stages of construction. Will you be able to withstand more-advanced enemy armies?</String>
		<String _locID="41021">They'll attack when THEY are ready, not when YOU are ready.</String>
		<String _locID="41022">These discoveries are fascinating. I must make more of them.</String>
		<String _locID="41023">Our scholars in the Sorbonne will welcome the chance to study such things.</String>
		<String _locID="41024">Ah yes, gathering riches will advance our cause.</String>
		<String _locID="41025">You can take that treasure. I wasn't going to get to it until later.</String>
		<String _locID="41026">We should combine our forces to destroy him at this point. I am sending my armies now.</String>
		<String _locID="41027">Please be careful about where you gather your treasures in the future. I will take care of those near my own town.</String>
		<String _locID="41028">Keep up the good work.</String>
		<String _locID="41029">How fine - already gathering your first treasures.</String>
		<String _locID="41030">A fine job in making discoveries. Do not neglect your town's development however.</String>
		<String _locID="41031">It is good to see you have so many treasures. You have not let your economy lag, I trust.</String>
		<String _locID="41032">Can you not find the treasures scattered around the landscape?</String>
		<String _locID="41033">There are treasures here, there, and everywhere. Are you blind?</String>
		<String _locID="41034">I realize this discovery was rather near to your town, but it will go to a good cause.</String>
		<String _locID="41035">Thank you for the treasure!</String>
		<String _locID="41036">You will need to make discoveries on your own for a time I fear. My explorer is indisposed.</String>
		<String _locID="41037">The French tricolor will stand at this point before we are done. Attaque l'outrance!</String>
		<String _locID="41039">I regret to report that my explorer was a bit too bold. He's dead.</String>
		<String _locID="41040">Now my forces are advanced far beyond your primitive imagination.</String>
		<String _locID="41041">You have fallen into my trap - advancing too soon!</String>
		<String _locID="41042">Did you wake up at last? Or were you stimulated to Age up by some kind of primeval instinct?</String>
		<String _locID="41043">You are doing well, I see. Please stay in the Discovery Age for as long as possible - preferably the rest of the game.</String>
		<String _locID="41044">You have nothing better to do but look for loot?</String>
		<String _locID="41045">I cannot waste my efforts on picking up random treasures. I have a war to win!</String>
		<String _locID="41046">You must not be very good at multitasking - I see that you have been unable to both gather treasures and try to build your town.</String>
		<String _locID="41047">I think this treasure now belongs to ME.</String>
		<String _locID="41048">By my calculations, the time is ripe to destroy the main enemy town here.</String>
		<String _locID="41049">I regret I do not currently have sufficient resources to help you.</String>
		<String _locID="41050">My resources are almost gone. I cannot do what you've requested.</String>
		<String _locID="41051">My sincerest apologies, but I cannot help at this time.</String>
		<String _locID="41052">I do not have any soldiers yet.</String>
		<String _locID="41053">I am working on other issues at this time, so I do not have an army.</String>
		<String _locID="41054">I have not yet taken the step of creating an army.</String>
		<String _locID="41055">I do not have sufficient men under arms - they would just be killed to no avail.</String>
		<String _locID="41056">My army is not ready to fight.</String>
		<String _locID="41057">My small army would make no difference in the fight. You'll have to do it yourself until I have built up more strength.</String>
		<String _locID="41058">Certainly.</String>
		<String _locID="41059">With the bounty of the New World at my disposal, nothing can stop me</String>
		<String _locID="41060">My men plunder the countryside for my glory.</String>
		<String _locID="41061">Where ever I turn, I find riches to aid the French cause.</String>
		<String _locID="41062">Pathetic... foraging in the forests like a hungry peasant.</String>
		<String _locID="41063">Grubbing in the dirt again? How sad for you.</String>
		<String _locID="41064">I see your explorer is out frantically accumulating random odds and ends. Your settlers must be very inefficient.</String>
		<String _locID="41065">Already reduced to foraging? Your settlers must be starving.</String>
		<String _locID="41066">Skill in exploration will not help you in the battles to come.</String>
		<String _locID="41067">You have accumulated almost no treasure. I had hoped for a more worthy opponent.</String>
		<String _locID="41068">The foolishness of an inexperienced leader... wandering so far from reinforcements.</String>
		<String _locID="41069">You'll pay for stealing that treasure. And soon.</String>
		<String _locID="41070">Ha! You fool, can't you even collect the treasure near your own town?</String>
		<String _locID="41071">You STILL have not advanced in Age? The situation would be laughable if it were not so serious for you.</String>
		<String _locID="41072">Advancing at this breakneck speed cannot be good for you in the long run - and that is when I will crush you.</String>
		<String _locID="41073">Finally, signs of life. Perhaps it will at least look like I had a challenge.</String>
		<String _locID="41074">Impressive technology. But can you do anything with it?</String>
		<String _locID="41075">Enjoy your brief edge over me while you can.</String>
		<String _locID="41076">Wasting your resources on bells and whistles I see. Aging up so early is a frivolity I can't afford.</String>
		<String _locID="41078">I have found you! All that remains is to fly a French flag over that town.</String>
		<String _locID="41079">You build near your ally... a sound strategy. Now I can annihilate you both.</String>
		<String _locID="41080">You build far from your ally's support. Because you are bold? Or simply foolhardy?</String>
		<String _locID="41081">My explorer is free. If you'd paid attention, you could have demanded ransom.</String>
		<String _locID="41082">My explorer has slipped through your clutches.</String>
		<String _locID="41083">Your grip is too weak, my friend. My explorer has escaped.</String>
		<String _locID="41084">I see... you cannot train troops, so you borrow them.</String>
		<String _locID="41085">I see your puny army. I guess a stealthy approach is beyond your limited capacity.</String>
		<String _locID="41086">Your army is so small and quaint. It almost seems a pity to wreck it.</String>
		<String _locID="41087">A tiny little army. How cute.</String>
		<String _locID="41088">Now that I see your troops, I know what your plan must be.</String>
		<String _locID="41089">Still letting your army wander aimlessly I see. I am sure your men wish they had a more capable commander.</String>
		<String _locID="41090">You have lost the element of surprise. If I were a lesser man, I might even be afraid.</String>
		<String _locID="41091">How ever did YOU come up with an army so large?</String>
		<String _locID="41092">Your army is nowhere near my base. Do you know where you're taking it?</String>
		<String _locID="41093">Worthwhile technique, trying to undercut my economy. More sophisticated than I would have expected from you.</String>
		<String _locID="41094">While you waste precious time chasing down my settlers, my invasion army readies.</String>
		<String _locID="41095">Stop that! Soldiers are meant to fight other soldiers, not civilians.</String>
		<String _locID="41096">You lack finesse, yet you are somehow effective. Perhaps I have underestimated you.</String>
		<String _locID="41097">Sacre bleu! Your forces... so lethal. I demand a rematch!</String>
		<String _locID="41098">I do not understand what went wrong. My unworthy subordinates must be to blame.</String>
		<String _locID="41099">Another battle, another day without a challenge. (Yawn)</String>
		<String _locID="41100">Vive le empereur!</String>
		<String _locID="41101">Once more French troops under my control prove victorious.</String>
		<String _locID="41102">If you were more cunning, I'd worry about what you're planning.</String>
		<String _locID="41103">Skilled commanders do not give their opponents a chance to rest. Thanks for the respite.</String>
		<String _locID="41104">One misfortune should not make one lose hope.</String>
		<String _locID="41105">If we cannot attack now, then it is indeed over.</String>
		<String _locID="41106">We have persevered this time, my friend.</String>
		<String _locID="41107">I told you that trust in me was well placed.</String>
		<String _locID="41108">Take it from an Ottoman. Artillery is what you need.</String>
		<String _locID="41109">Make falconets... cannon... any kind of artillery will help you now.</String>
		<String _locID="41110">Cavalry will cut them down like lions among bunnies.</String>
		<String _locID="41111">Train cavalry, my friend. I do it all the time. It is very nice.</String>
		<String _locID="41112">Send in swordsmen or muskets. Anything on two legs.</String>
		<String _locID="41113">We Ottomans have won many battles with infantry. I suggest you try that strategy now.</String>
		<String _locID="41114">The mouse who has only one hole soon gets caught. You should retreat carefully, my Ally.</String>
		<String _locID="41115">No matter how far you have gone down a wrong road, turn back. Retreat and live, my friend.</String>
		<String _locID="41116">The battle you enter will be bloody. I advise caution, my Ally. Even retreat.</String>
		<String _locID="41117">Be careful, the enemy seems an ant, but I see  him an elephant.</String>
		<String _locID="41118">Rethink your fight, my friend, we can discuss plans over cups of frothing ayran.</String>
		<String _locID="41119">When enemies gather like bees to honey victory will be sweet.</String>
		<String _locID="41120">They are afraid of us, see how they rally together.</String>
		<String _locID="41121">I prefer a nice warm bath after winning such an easy battle.</String>
		<String _locID="41122">One does not burn a blanket to get rid of a flea like our enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="41123">We will drink thick boza to toast my victory. You do like chickpeas, yes?</String>
		<String _locID="41124">Another victory for the armies of the Ottoman Empire.</String>
		<String _locID="41125">If a man is judged by his work, I will be a hero when I return home.</String>
		<String _locID="41126">Luck has found me today.</String>
		<String _locID="41127">A hard won victory for our noble Alliance!</String>
		<String _locID="41128">My soldiers fight like lions.</String>
		<String _locID="41130">My armies will be wolves among sheep.</String>
		<String _locID="41131">Perhaps after this battle you would join me for a meal.</String>
		<String _locID="41132">This battle will be good practice for my men.</String>
		<String _locID="41133">I will leave this battle to one of my Viziers.</String>
		<String _locID="41134">Our enemy is a green twig, easily bent... and broken.</String>
		<String _locID="41135">This battle will be short.</String>
		<String _locID="41136">A heavy stone is not easily moved. Thank you for your aid.</String>
		<String _locID="41137">Reinforcements have turned the tide just as drop by drop, water will make a pond.</String>
		<String _locID="41138">Our enemies gather like buzzing flies!</String>
		<String _locID="41139">Another army joins the battle! They multiply like rabbits!</String>
		<String _locID="41140">I agree. The candle does not give light to itself.</String>
		<String _locID="41141">I will.</String>
		<String _locID="41142">I honor your request.</String>
		<String _locID="41143">To this I agree.</String>
		<String _locID="41144">I am Ottoman. Artillery is my specialty.</String>
		<String _locID="41145">More cannon! More cannon for my good friend!</String>
		<String _locID="41146">Artillery you say? It will be my pleasure!</String>
		<String _locID="41147">I will train cannon and guard them with Hussars.</String>
		<String _locID="41148">I will send janissaries and cannon.</String>
		<String _locID="41149">You will hear the charge of a thousand horses.</String>
		<String _locID="41150">I agree with that assessment. We will train cavalry to use against the enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="41151">Ottomans have strong hussars. We will be glad to bring them to battle.</String>
		<String _locID="41152">I will train hussars and support them with cannon.</String>
		<String _locID="41153">I will train a mixed army -- some horse and some foot.</String>
		<String _locID="41154">We will sharpen our scimitars and polish our muskets and prepare a glorious army of infantry.</String>
		<String _locID="41155">Janissaries it is then!</String>
		<String _locID="41156">My janissaries will enjoy marching into battle.</String>
		<String _locID="41157">Janissaries and artillery. The perfect Ottoman army!</String>
		<String _locID="41158">We will train janissaries and support them with cavalry units.</String>
		<String _locID="41159">Alas, my coffers are empty.</String>
		<String _locID="41160">All that I have would be yours, my friend, if indeed I had anything.</String>
		<String _locID="41161">Although I must suffer in great agony for denying such a noble request I still must do so.</String>
		<String _locID="41162">I am not worthy to be your ally, for I cannot afford your request. I hope someday your children's children can forgive me.</String>
		<String _locID="41163">That would be possible, yet I seem to have spent what little I had.</String>
		<String _locID="41164">You can ask a thousand times, and the answer will still be no.</String>
		<String _locID="41165">Such a thing is impossible.</String>
		<String _locID="41166">Although you deserve much more, such a thing is not to be.</String>
		<String _locID="41167">I would grant you the keys to the gates of paradise if I could, but for now, I can do nothing.</String>
		<String _locID="41168">I know it is your expectation the Ottoman army to be mighty and endless, but sometimes our reputation precedes us and we have not the troops just yet.</String>
		<String _locID="41169">I could send you our finest cooks, tailors and animal handlers, but as for soldiers, we have none.</String>
		<String _locID="41170">We are a long way from the Ottoman Empire, my friend, and I have not the troops to spare.</String>
		<String _locID="41171">If such a thing were possible, but it is not.</String>
		<String _locID="41172">A force greater than both of us prevents that.</String>
		<String _locID="41173">It has been decreed that such a thing is not to be.</String>
		<String _locID="41174">We are but a poor colony with few soldiers.</String>
		<String _locID="41175">I have a janissary or two, but not enough to be of assistance.</String>
		<String _locID="41176">My troops are dining at the moment. I cannot spare them.</String>
		<String _locID="41177">We were so close to victory, my friend. Perhaps we should try again.</String>
		<String _locID="41178">They destroyed one of our trading posts and stole our well-deserved victory away.</String>
		<String _locID="41179">The British are very weak.</String>
		<String _locID="41180">The Dutch will resign soon.</String>
		<String _locID="41181">The French will surrender. They often do.</String>
		<String _locID="41182">I have fought Germans many times, so I know they will soon resign.</String>
		<String _locID="41183">There is only room for one Ottoman colony. And it will be mine.</String>
		<String _locID="41184">We will drive them back to Portugal!</String>
		<String _locID="41185">These Russians will not be a threat much longer.</String>
		<String _locID="41186">Remember back when the Spanish were actually dangerous?</String>
		<String _locID="41187">The British army is quite strong.</String>
		<String _locID="41188">I do not know how they do it, but the Dutch are a big threat.</String>
		<String _locID="41189">France often has a huge army and I fear this time is no exception.</String>
		<String _locID="41190">I have fought Germans many times. They can be quite dangerous.</String>
		<String _locID="41191">It appears I have a rival for control of the Ottoman Empire.</String>
		<String _locID="41192">Keep your eye on the Portuguese. They are our biggest threat.</String>
		<String _locID="41193">Russians like to attack early. Be prepared.</String>
		<String _locID="41194">These Spanish often have strong infantry and cavalry.</String>
		<String _locID="41195">You advance quickly. That is good, but do not over extend yourself.</String>
		<String _locID="41196">I have seen birds that do not fly as fast as you. I hope you did not advance too early.</String>
		<String _locID="41197">You must have resources coming in quickly to be able to go up before me. Let us use that to our advantage.</String>
		<String _locID="41198">Our enemy is forging alliances with the local people.</String>
		<String _locID="41199">Did you see that? Our enemy has allied with another native American.</String>
		<String _locID="41200">Our enemy appears to be going for a native American strategy.</String>
		<String _locID="41201">Let our enemy forge alliances. It will come to naught in the end.</String>
		<String _locID="41202">You need to advance in Age if you are to have a military.</String>
		<String _locID="41203">Is this some secret strategy, my friend, or have hard times fallen upon you?</String>
		<String _locID="41204">Staying in an early Age for so long can be dangerous...</String>
		<String _locID="41205">Are you behind, my friend? How can I help?</String>
		<String _locID="41206">Have faith, my ally. Though you are behind, it is not too late to advance to the next Age.</String>
		<String _locID="41207">He who asks advice passes the mountain; he who does not loses his way on the level plain. Do you need aid?</String>
		<String _locID="41208">We are allies, it is no shame to ask for help.</String>
		<String _locID="41209">Do you need coin or food to advance in Age? I will share if I can.</String>
		<String _locID="41210">You have beaten our enemy to the second Age!</String>
		<String _locID="41211">If skills could be learned by watching, every dog would be a butcher and we would all advance in Age with you.</String>
		<String _locID="41212">Activity breeds prosperity.</String>
		<String _locID="41213">One day share with me the secret of your speed.</String>
		<String _locID="41214">Our enemies will eat the dust kicked up by your progress.</String>
		<String _locID="41215">With patience mulberry leaves become satin. I am sure you are weaving very fine cloth.</String>
		<String _locID="41216">A horse ridden slowly reaches its destination, my friend.</String>
		<String _locID="41217">The enemy rushes forward blindly in haste. You are patient and wise.</String>
		<String _locID="41218">Silks made slowly, wear longest.</String>
		<String _locID="41219">We harvest what we sow. You have sown patience, we will harvest victory.</String>
		<String _locID="41220">My explorer is rescued. You have the gratitude of the Ottoman Empire.</String>
		<String _locID="41221">My explorer is on his feet. I will send word of your deeds to his family.</String>
		<String _locID="41222">You have rescued my explorer and saved me coin! I am truly grateful.</String>
		<String _locID="41223">My explorer, you saved him. I hope that he may be of service to you soon.</String>
		<String _locID="41224">The family of my explorer sends their gratitude for his rescue.</String>
		<String _locID="41225">My faithful explorer is rescued. Hopefully he will be more cautious in the future.</String>
		<String _locID="41226">I have saved us from the lion's jaws!</String>
		<String _locID="41227">I have stopped the timer! We must take advantage of this opportunity.</String>
		<String _locID="41228">Our enemies will barter with these natives no more.</String>
		<String _locID="41229">These natives may wish to barter with us now.</String>
		<String _locID="41230">Our enemy's alliance with these natives is broken.</String>
		<String _locID="41231">These natives may wish to ally with the Ottomans now.</String>
		<String _locID="41232">Again, I have conquered our enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="41233">I have brought falling embers to our enemy's colony.</String>
		<String _locID="41234">Our enemy's colony sheds embers into the darkening sky.</String>
		<String _locID="41235">The cries and smoke are thick in our enemy's colony.</String>
		<String _locID="41236">White clothes become dirty. Our enemy's colony is no more.</String>
		<String _locID="41237">Our enemy will not grow fat from this trading post.</String>
		<String _locID="41238">The enemy controls this trading post no longer.</String>
		<String _locID="41239">This trading post is dead to me.</String>
		<String _locID="41240">I have destroyed an enemy trading post.</String>
		<String _locID="41241">Our enemy's trading post is burnt to the ground.</String>
		<String _locID="41242">The enemy's alliance with this tribe is sound, I will have to try again.</String>
		<String _locID="41243">Our enemy's alliance with this tribe is as thick as marble.</String>
		<String _locID="41244">I did not expect their buildings to be so well constructed...</String>
		<String _locID="41245">The enemy colony still stands... for now.</String>
		<String _locID="41246">I underestimated their preparedness. It will not happen again, my Ally.</String>
		<String _locID="41247">My most sincere apologies, ally. I did not destroy the trading post.</String>
		<String _locID="41248">You must excuse me, my ally, my explorer has fallen and I must prepare his family for the news.</String>
		<String _locID="41249">This New World is full of evil beasts with sharp teeth, some of which have claimed my explorer.</String>
		<String _locID="41250">There is little to gain from further conflict.</String>
		<String _locID="41251">I am fighting our enemy here - rally your soldiers to the banner of Suleiman the Magnificent!</String>
		<String _locID="41252">My colony is overrun!</String>
		<String _locID="41253">The enemy swarms my colony like fleas on a camel!</String>
		<String _locID="41254">I am besieged! At meal time! Our enemy is less than a dog.</String>
		<String _locID="41255">I am Suleiman the Magnificent. Perhaps you have heard of me?</String>
		<String _locID="41256">I am Suleiman the Magnificent. I toast the beginning of our alliance with warm boza!</String>
		<String _locID="41257">I am Suleiman the Magnificent. I AM the Ottoman Empire.</String>
		<String _locID="41258">Our engagements grow more and more challenging. I trust you are ready.</String>
		<String _locID="41259">You are wise to choose your battles carefully. A stair is climbed step by step.</String>
		<String _locID="41260">He who was once my enemy is now my friend.</String>
		<String _locID="41261">Greetings again. Perhaps this time I will keep up with you.</String>
		<String _locID="41262">So I defeated you before, and now you come to me as an ally? So be it. I shall not turn you away.</String>
		<String _locID="41263">I hope that you learned from me during our last encounter.</String>
		<String _locID="41264">Be strong this time. One crow does not make winter.</String>
		<String _locID="41265">You like to fight on this map, yes?</String>
		<String _locID="41266">This time we shall win. Patience is the key to paradise.</String>
		<String _locID="41267">So, shall we drive them before us once more?</String>
		<String _locID="41268">Once a friend, always a friend. We will be victorious again.</String>
		<String _locID="41269">My explorer is restored to me, his family has sent ransom in cattle and silks.</String>
		<String _locID="41270">Good. My explorer can now resume humble service to Suleiman the Magnificent.</String>
		<String _locID="41271">Our mutual enemy's town appears defenseless.</String>
		<String _locID="41272">It seems our enemy's colony is undefended.</String>
		<String _locID="41273">Our enemy appears to have no infantry. Perhaps we should strike.</String>
		<String _locID="41274">I have seen the enemy town and did not see a barracks. We should not expect an army of infantry.</String>
		<String _locID="41275">My scouts report that our enemy is not training cavalry.</String>
		<String _locID="41276">Ottoman scouts report that there is no stable in our enemy's colony.</String>
		<String _locID="41277">Ottomans always have coin to spare.</String>
		<String _locID="41278">I will share my wealth.</String>
		<String _locID="41279">The generosity of the Ottoman Empire is legendary. Have some coin.</String>
		<String _locID="41280">I was going to commission a new saddle for my horse, but perhaps this coin is better spent on you instead.</String>
		<String _locID="41281">You can never say that Suleiman never gave you anything.</String>
		<String _locID="41282">He who has no bread has no authority.</String>
		<String _locID="41283">A person cannot fight on an empty stomach.</String>
		<String _locID="41284">Janissaries are famous for their cooking. Perhaps you'd like a taste?</String>
		<String _locID="41285">Olives from the Mediterranean. Dates from Mesopotamia. All for you to sample.</String>
		<String _locID="41286">Janissaries never march to war without their soup pots. Perhaps you'd like to share?</String>
		<String _locID="41287">This lumber came all the way from Asia.</String>
		<String _locID="41288">Wood. Wood for buildings, for ships, and for artillery.</String>
		<String _locID="41289">Here, my friend. Use this wood for the glory of both our nations.</String>
		<String _locID="41290">To celebrate our alliance, I have sent you a gift of fine lumber.</String>
		<String _locID="41291">I was going to cast this away, seeing how flush with resources my colonies are, but perhaps you can make use of this wood.</String>
		<String _locID="41292">Prepare to witness my magnificent attack upon our unsuspecting enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="41293">Like a wind across the desert, my forces ride towards the enemy colony.</String>
		<String _locID="41294">We will fall upon the enemy colony like lions at the feast.</String>
		<String _locID="41295">Study this colony well. In a moment there will be nothing left.</String>
		<String _locID="41296">Now you will see the full might of the Ottoman Empire as we raze this town.</String>
		<String _locID="41297">Now you will watch as the little people flee before me!</String>
		<String _locID="41298">If you see smoke on the horizon, it is my army in our enemy's town.</String>
		<String _locID="41299">My soldiers rally under the crescent banner. We march!</String>
		<String _locID="41300">Our enemy has forged an alliance with the natives here. It will not last.</String>
		<String _locID="41301">He who has no bread has no authority. I go to take the bread from our enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="41302">My soldiers march to join yours, my ally.</String>
		<String _locID="41303">Guests bring good luck - I will join you in your attack.</String>
		<String _locID="41304">A wise man remembers his friends at all times. I am sending soldiers with you.</String>
		<String _locID="41305">I am building a new camp to train soldiers.</String>
		<String _locID="41306">The Ottomans claim this territory for our next colony.</String>
		<String _locID="41307">Soon this land too will experience the bounty of the Ottoman Empire.</String>
		<String _locID="41308">Suleiman the Magnificent claims this land for a new colony.</String>
		<String _locID="41309">I am going to convince these native Americans to form an alliance.</String>
		<String _locID="41310">A thousand friends are too few. I will try to ally with the native Americans here.</String>
		<String _locID="41311">We need more trade. I will start with this site.</String>
		<String _locID="41312">Coffee and silk will bring great wealth in these lands. I will build a trading post.</String>
		<String _locID="41313">This building shall not fall.</String>
		<String _locID="41314">I will not let this building fall while my soldiers have breath.</String>
		<String _locID="41315">I will make my stand here.</String>
		<String _locID="41316">I will hold this ground until star and moon fall.</String>
		<String _locID="41317">I will defend our alliance with the native Americans.</String>
		<String _locID="41318">I am sending soldiers to protect our alliance with the native Americans.</String>
		<String _locID="41319">My soldiers will defend this town through a thousand winters.</String>
		<String _locID="41320">This town will not fall to our enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="41321">I will defend the Trade Route. One who handles honey licks his fingers.</String>
		<String _locID="41322">Gold does not rust on the ground, but this trading post will not defend itself.</String>
		<String _locID="41323">I will share the wealth of my empire by sending you coin.</String>
		<String _locID="41324">When my coffers overflow, I will send extra coin to you.</String>
		<String _locID="41325">My silos are full. I can send you Food.</String>
		<String _locID="41326">A red apple invites stones, but I will continue to share my Food with you.</String>
		<String _locID="41327">If you can still use wood, I will continue to send it.</String>
		<String _locID="41328">Our buildings are of stone and plaster, I will send you wood that we do not use.</String>
		<String _locID="41329">I am on my way. Hold as long as you can!</String>
		<String _locID="41330">My soldiers rally to your flag!</String>
		<String _locID="41331">The armies of Suleiman the Magnificent will arrive soon.</String>
		<String _locID="41332">My people say if you have never been sun burned, you will never know a shadow's value.</String>
		<String _locID="41333">My people say listen a hundred times; ponder a thousand times; speak once.</String>
		<String _locID="41334">My people say two watermelons cannot be held under one arm.</String>
		<String _locID="41335">My people say coffee should be strong as death, sweet as love, and black as hell.</String>
		<String _locID="41336">My people say the plumber's house always leaks.</String>
		<String _locID="41337">My people say you will reach for a snake if you fall into the sea.</String>
		<String _locID="41338">My people say do not search for a calf under the ox.</String>
		<String _locID="41339">A wise man remembers his friends at all times; a fool, only when he has need of them.</String>
		<String _locID="41340">Patience is bitter, but it bears sweet fruit.</String>
		<String _locID="41341">My people say no one gives alms to a closed palm. Do you need anything?</String>
		<String _locID="41342">If you trust me as an ally, you will send me coin.</String>
		<String _locID="41343">Can you spare coin? It will be a good investment.</String>
		<String _locID="41344">Do you have Food you can spare?</String>
		<String _locID="41345">An open mouth remains not hungry. I need Food, my ally.</String>
		<String _locID="41346">Send me wood, my friend.</String>
		<String _locID="41347">My colony grows. Can you spare some wood?</String>
		<String _locID="41348">The sight of your army makes me smile, friend.</String>
		<String _locID="41349">I shall treat your army to a feast when we are done!</String>
		<String _locID="41350">Your soldiers are a welcome sight!</String>
		<String _locID="41351">I can use that coin. My thanks.</String>
		<String _locID="41352">We shall put this Food to good use.</String>
		<String _locID="41353">My thanks for your assistance. It takes two hands to make a sound.</String>
		<String _locID="41354">I, Suleiman the Magnificent, thank you.</String>
		<String _locID="41355">The Ottoman Empire thanks you.</String>
		<String _locID="41356">I will spend any resources you can send to me.</String>
		<String _locID="41357">Ah, more wood. Excellent.</String>
		<String _locID="41358">The British are cunning and their armies are well-equipped. It does not look good for us.</String>
		<String _locID="41359">The Dutch know more of warfare than I expected. The outlook is grim.</String>
		<String _locID="41360">The French are as dangerous as I feared. We fight a losing fight.</String>
		<String _locID="41361">The Germans are a relentless enemy. We are losing ground.</String>
		<String _locID="41362">It is not surprising that one of my countrymen is a match for both of us.</String>
		<String _locID="41363">The Portuguese are endlessly resourceful. This is a dark day.</String>
		<String _locID="41364">Is there nothing we can do to turn the Russian tide?</String>
		<String _locID="41365">The Spanish stand poised to crush us. We only have to wait.</String>
		<String _locID="41366">My children's grandchildren will be shamed by losing to the British.</String>
		<String _locID="41367">Despite their inferior troops, the Dutch continue to defeat us.</String>
		<String _locID="41368">It is humiliating that we are losing to the French.</String>
		<String _locID="41369">If we lose to the Germans, I will never be considered fit to lead in battle again.</String>
		<String _locID="41370">I cannot stand to lose to this traitorous Ottoman commander.</String>
		<String _locID="41371">I cannot believe you allowed the Portuguese to beat us.</String>
		<String _locID="41372">The Russians swarm like ants... and we let them.</String>
		<String _locID="41373">I do not know how I allowed the Spanish to beat us.</String>
		<String _locID="41374">We sprinkle blood on a dying tree. Blood I can spare no longer.</String>
		<String _locID="41375">My armies have fought like lions to protect our colonies, but it is not enough.</String>
		<String _locID="41376">A white day sheds light, a black day sheds darkness. This is a white day.</String>
		<String _locID="41377">You do well, my ally. A lion sleeps in the heart of every brave man.</String>
		<String _locID="41378">Though I am the stronger, I know you will still contribute to this alliance.</String>
		<String _locID="41379">We fought valiantly, but the time has come to resign.</String>
		<String _locID="41380">A white day sheds light, a black day sheds darkness. This is a black day.</String>
		<String _locID="41381">Every sheep is hung by his own leg, I fear we head toward slaughter.</String>
		<String _locID="41382">We cannot win this. Empty words will not fill an empty stomach.</String>
		<String _locID="41383">Even the highest tree has an axe waiting at its foot. We are finished.</String>
		<String _locID="41384">Either drive this camel to pasture or leave the country - we are done here!</String>
		<String _locID="41385">It is easier to teach a camel to jump than to convince you to resign!</String>
		<String _locID="41386">We should have known they would try to win this way.</String>
		<String _locID="41387">Our enemy has established an alliance with some of the native Americans here. We should pursue our own alliances.</String>
		<String _locID="41388">Our enemy is swift or we are slow. We should build our own trading posts. Or destroy his.</String>
		<String _locID="41389">The native Americans have found a strong ally in you.</String>
		<String _locID="41390">And in another thing you are the first.</String>
		<String _locID="41391">It is wise to establish trade while others only consider it.</String>
		<String _locID="41392">Your explorer has keen eyes!</String>
		<String _locID="41393">Excellent! Your discovery will speed our victory!</String>
		<String _locID="41394">I'm sure that will fetch a fine price at the bazaar, my friend.</String>
		<String _locID="41395">It is a fine explorer that feeds his people. But beware the choke-cherries.</String>
		<String _locID="41396">My explorer is more diplomat than outdoorsman, I would be honored if your explorer tutored him.</String>
		<String _locID="41397">Take it. My people say, 'Let your neighbor be well off, for then he will not ask you for anything.'</String>
		<String _locID="41398">A native American warrior will be a great aid to you.</String>
		<String _locID="41399">Your compassion for the helpless will return to us in time.</String>
		<String _locID="41400">Your explorer has a good eye for the exotic woods found here.</String>
		<String _locID="41401">Your alliances with the native people will serve us well.</String>
		<String _locID="41402">Eat and drink with your friends, but do not trade with them. Present company excluded, of course.</String>
		<String _locID="41403">I have this advice for your walls -- measure a thousand times; cut once.</String>
		<String _locID="41404">Remember, small keys unlock big doors. And cannon. Cannon work also.</String>
		<String _locID="41405">My emissaries have secured the first alliance with the native Americans.</String>
		<String _locID="41406">This land is in need of dates and silks. I will sell Ottoman luxuries in the wilderness.</String>
		<String _locID="41407">This land is vast and full of wonders.</String>
		<String _locID="41408">Hmm... this New World could prove lucrative after all.</String>
		<String _locID="41409">Exotic Food for my new colony. Did I warn you about choke-cherries?</String>
		<String _locID="41410">My apologies. This explorer is young and eager. He will not gather treasures on your doorstep again.</String>
		<String _locID="41411">My explorer is swift and keen-eyed. But I'm sure there are still treasures for you to claim.</String>
		<String _locID="41412">A native American warrior. He will be a great help to my efforts.</String>
		<String _locID="41413">There is much to learn, but each settler builds a piece of the Ottoman Empire.</String>
		<String _locID="41414">There is little wood in our architecture; still, this wood is useful.</String>
		<String _locID="41415">The sincerity of my words draws more allies to our alliance.</String>
		<String _locID="41416">Our enemy has glutted the markets with baubles and trash. Now all will see superior Ottoman goods.</String>
		<String _locID="41417">I am building a wall around my colony. An open door is an invitation to the viper.</String>
		<String _locID="41418">A red apple invites stones. Our prosperity will make us a target. We must prepare.</String>
		<String _locID="41419">Sorrow is to the soul what the worm is to wood. Do not let your losses eat at you.</String>
		<String _locID="41420">Stairs are climbed step by step. Though you appear to have leapt them two by two.</String>
		<String _locID="41421">You have seen many battles since we last met. Let us win this one together.</String>
		<String _locID="41422">There is still time for me to pull victory from the lion's mouth.</String>
		<String _locID="41423">We persevered, and so we shall be rewarded.</String>
		<String _locID="41424">It is the aunt or uncle of all battles!</String>
		<String _locID="41425">No matter how tall a tree grows its leaves always fall to the ground.</String>
		<String _locID="41426">A dog that intends to bite does not bare its teeth. I will remember this for next time.</String>
		<String _locID="41427">It is more difficult to contend with oneself than the world. This defeat is my own.</String>
		<String _locID="41428">You are a worthy enemy. I will stop underestimating you.</String>
		<String _locID="41429">You turned my attacks as the moon turns the tide. I must rethink my strategy.</String>
		<String _locID="41430">I have learned from this battle. Do not expect that you will win another.</String>
		<String _locID="41431">You have won a great victory, but as rain does not soak marble, you will not defeat me.</String>
		<String _locID="41432">Bah... I would have won that engagement, but you made me spill coffee on my robes.</String>
		<String _locID="41433">You lose. A donkey is a donkey even when he is finely saddled.</String>
		<String _locID="41434">Try not to get too much blood on my robes. They are Oriental silk. Very expensive.</String>
		<String _locID="41435">If anyone weeps for you, it will be your mother; others will only pretend to weep.</String>
		<String _locID="41436">A man becomes experienced by being defeated; a scholar, by making mistakes. I think you must be very learned.</String>
		<String _locID="41437">Beauty passes, wisdom remains. You must be very wise to have stolen victory from me.</String>
		<String _locID="41438">He who would gather honey must bear the sting of bees.</String>
		<String _locID="41439">Your soldiers are in disarray. Their leader sounds an uncertain trumpet.</String>
		<String _locID="41440">Sorrow is to the soul what the worm is to wood.</String>
		<String _locID="41441">The battle is turning. The cock that crows too early gets his head cut off.</String>
		<String _locID="41442">Only your ally saved you this time. Next time you will not be so fortunate.</String>
		<String _locID="41443">You Age up quickly, but every man has his own way of eating yogurt.</String>
		<String _locID="41444">What flares up fast, extinguishes soon.</String>
		<String _locID="41445">Your Native Allies will make no difference in the end.</String>
		<String _locID="41446">If you have something to say to me, say it in my town and leave my allies out of this.</String>
		<String _locID="41447">You will pay for what you have done.</String>
		<String _locID="41448">Relish your victory, but know that the liar's candle will only last until evening.</String>
		<String _locID="41449">Yet once again we see that beauty passes. Wisdom remains.</String>
		<String _locID="41450">You grow lethargic in the first Age. For the lean ox, there is no knife.</String>
		<String _locID="41451">Are you still competing, or have you gone off to compose music?</String>
		<String _locID="41452">To the snake that does not bite me, may he live a thousand years.</String>
		<String _locID="41453">Do not roll up your trousers before reaching the stream.</String>
		<String _locID="41454">The fly in a hurry falls into the milk.</String>
		<String _locID="41455">Oh, I forgot about you. Are you still in this fight?</String>
		<String _locID="41456">Two camels fight and the fly in between dies. You will be crushed.</String>
		<String _locID="41457">You are miles away from your ally. You have no hope.</String>
		<String _locID="41458">You are alone... a sheep separated from the flock.</String>
		<String _locID="41459">You huddle together like baby chickens!</String>
		<String _locID="41460">That is quite enough of that!</String>
		<String _locID="41461">This too shall be mine.</String>
		<String _locID="41462">Suleiman the Magnificent pronounces this colony unfit. Resign now, and you may leave in peace.</String>
		<String _locID="41463">This building offended me, so I have destroyed it.</String>
		<String _locID="41464">Watch your tongue when you speak to me. Sharp vinegar only damages its container.</String>
		<String _locID="41465">You will harvest what you sow.</String>
		<String _locID="41466">The fly is small, but it can upset your stomach.</String>
		<String _locID="41467">There is no rose without a thorn, nor contest without a rival.</String>
		<String _locID="41468">A weapon is an enemy, even to its owner.</String>
		<String _locID="41469">A thousand friends are too few; one enemy is too many. You will learn the truth of this soon.</String>
		<String _locID="41470">I see you enjoy a challenge. Then I shall give you one.</String>
		<String _locID="41471">Yes, I was too much for you last battle. I will go easier on you this time.</String>
		<String _locID="41472">Very well, we shall try again.</String>
		<String _locID="41473">You bit off more bread than you could swallow last time. Perhaps this time will go better for you.</String>
		<String _locID="41474">You leap into a sea full of sharks!</String>
		<String _locID="41475">A daring rescue that will be the subject of a hundred poems.</String>
		<String _locID="41476">I have looked into the eyes of my enemy and I do not like what I see there.</String>
		<String _locID="41477">I see your soldiers. Do not think they are hiding.</String>
		<String _locID="41478">Is this a raid? Are you sure you are ready? I will not go easy on you.</String>
		<String _locID="41479">The hare was angry at the mountain, but the mountain was unaware of it. Your army is meaningless.</String>
		<String _locID="41480">You prey on those who cannot defend themselves. There is no honor in that.</String>
		<String _locID="41481">An army that size... I suspect they do not bring tidings of your imminent surrender.</String>
		<String _locID="41482">In case your runners have been lost. Your army has strayed into my territory. I would advise you to withdraw.</String>
		<String _locID="41483">Suleiman the Magnificent will not forget how you attacked this colony.</String>
		<String _locID="41484">Ah... a scouting party. A wise man speaks of what he sees.</String>
		<String _locID="41485">There is no need for a guide to a village which is visible.</String>
		<String _locID="41486">I see your colony, there. I told my cartographers not to bother adding it to their map.</String>
		<String _locID="41487">A bird steals bread from beneath the nose of the unwary.</String>
		<String _locID="41488">Better to die on an empty stomach than live on an empty one. You have eaten, yes?</String>
		<String _locID="41489">A single misfortune is better than a thousand warnings!</String>
		<String _locID="41490">A good man will appear when talked about. You must have said my name.</String>
		<String _locID="41491">He who steals a minaret prepares a case for it.</String>
		<String _locID="41492">When you are an anvil, be patient; when you are a hammer, be strong.</String>
		<String _locID="41493">A carefree head is only found on a scarecrow.</String>
		<String _locID="41494">I admit defeat. Will you accept my surrender?</String>
		<String _locID="41498">I have struggled against you long enough. Shall we call this finished?</String>
		<String _locID="41500">Enough! You have won. I will resign if you will permit me.</String>
		<String _locID="41502">Thorns and roses grow on the same tree. The rose you have found will soon show you its thorns.</String>
		<String _locID="41503">Do not think Suleiman is blind to the tendrils you spread across the New World.</String>
		<String _locID="41504">Your explorer is eager. He better watch out for bears. And janissaries.</String>
		<String _locID="41505">I am sure news of your discovery will make all the effort worthwhile.</String>
		<String _locID="41506">I think I heard a clinking of coin into your coffers. Spend it wisely.</String>
		<String _locID="41507">Be careful of the Food in this New World. Especially the choke cherries.</String>
		<String _locID="41508">Send my compliments to your explorer for his collection of unusual vermin and weeds.</String>
		<String _locID="41509">Stay away from my town. The sheep separated from the flock gets eaten by the wolf.</String>
		<String _locID="41510">Native Americans know these lands well, I curse that I did not find him before you did.</String>
		<String _locID="41511">You will have need of every settler you have when I begin my attacks.</String>
		<String _locID="41512">You should use that wood to build a boat and sail home. Or perhaps I can loan you a swift Ottoman Galley.</String>
		<String _locID="41513">Build defenses if you must, but an over-protected eye always gets the speck.</String>
		<String _locID="41514">Do you forget I am Ottoman? I will bring artillery to knock down your silly walls.</String>
		<String _locID="41515">My skillful diplomats have forged alliance with the natives here while you ignore them.</String>
		<String _locID="41516">The wealth of the Ottoman Empire is built on trade. Why should the New World be different?</String>
		<String _locID="41517">This too is mine.</String>
		<String _locID="41518">All the New World is Suleiman's to explore.</String>
		<String _locID="41519">If you could only see how much wealth we have amassed!</String>
		<String _locID="41520">More Food for my soldiers.</String>
		<String _locID="41521">I fly in like a hawk to grasp a treasure right under your nose.</String>
		<String _locID="41522">You seem to be having trouble finding treasures. Would it help if I pointed them all out to you?</String>
		<String _locID="41523">The Ottomans accept people of all cultures into our glorious Empire.</String>
		<String _locID="41524">More population for the Ottoman Empire!</String>
		<String _locID="41525">I will use this wood to make more buildings for the Ottoman Empire.</String>
		<String _locID="41526">It will not be long before the native Americans see your true treachery.</String>
		<String _locID="41527">No one will want the worthless trinkets you peddle at your trade post</String>
		<String _locID="41528">My armies will crush the victory you seek. But where will they strike?</String>
		<String _locID="41529">There are many places you must defend. But where will Suleiman attack?</String>
		<String _locID="41530">My victory is inevitable. Surrender and I will treat you and your soldiers to a feast in my colony.</String>
		<String _locID="41531">The moment of my victory approaches. I can hear the bombards sounding.</String>
		<String _locID="41532">I see you have learned that every downhill has an uphill. And every uphill, a downhill.</String>
		<String _locID="41533">I hear your name in the whispers of conquered foes. I would watch your back.</String>
		<String _locID="41534">You have fought more battles since last we met. My tent is lined with banners of experienced leaders like you.</String>

		<String _locID="47358">You were wise to hit our enemy there. I will follow up your attack.</String>
		<String _locID="47359">My warriors will train from here.</String>
		<String _locID="47360">My people will set up camp here.</String>
		<String _locID="47361">I will seek the help of my Native brothers.</String>
		<String _locID="47362">I will take this trade site.</String>
		<String _locID="47363">My people will defend this building.</String>
		<String _locID="47364">My warriors will defend this area.</String>
		<String _locID="47365">I will defend my Native brothers here.</String>
		<String _locID="47366">The people in this town will resist to the last man.</String>
		<String _locID="47367">I will tell my warriors to defend this trading post.</String>
		<String _locID="47368">My people have plenty of wealth. We will send some to you.</String>
		<String _locID="47369">Our harvests have been bountiful. We will send you food.</String>
		<String _locID="47370">The forests here have given us much. We will continue to send you wood.</String>
		<String _locID="47371">My people are on their way to help you here.</String>
		<String _locID="47372">The spirits have been quiet lately.</String>
		<String _locID="47373">My people have need of coin.</String>
		<String _locID="47374">The herds are thin. We need food.</String>
		<String _locID="47375">My people need wood to expand our territory.</String>
		<String _locID="47376">Your help in that battle was well-timed.</String>
		<String _locID="47377">You have my thanks for the coin.</String>
		<String _locID="47378">This food will help. Thank you.</String>
		<String _locID="47379">Your quick action saved many of my people.</String>
		<String _locID="47380">Those resources will nourish my people.</String>
		<String _locID="47381">This wood will help us to build.</String>
		<String _locID="47382">Their voyage across the sea has made these British strong.</String>
		<String _locID="47383">These Dutchmen are strong fighters.</String>
		<String _locID="47384">I would not have believed these Frenchmen to be so strong.</String>
		<String _locID="47385">These Germans have more fight than I had hoped.</String>
		<String _locID="47386">This empire has produced a worthy enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="47387">These Portuguese have the strength of the buffalo.</String>
		<String _locID="47388">These Russians are a strong-willed people.</String>
		<String _locID="47389">These Spanish warriors fight with skill.</String>
		<String _locID="47390">The reputation of the Aztecs is well-deserved.</String>
		<String _locID="47391">It is no surprise that these Natives are fierce warriors.</String>
		<String _locID="47392">Our difficulties against the Sioux are not surprising.</String>
		<String _locID="47393">How can we be losing to these weak British?</String>
		<String _locID="47394">We struggle against an inferior Dutch army.</String>
		<String _locID="47395">I am puzzled by our failure to rout these weak Frenchmen.</String>
		<String _locID="47396">These Germans are weak. We should be doing better.</String>
		<String _locID="47397">These Ottomans win despite our superiority.</String>
		<String _locID="47398">How do these Portuguese better us, the stronger team?</String>
		<String _locID="47399">These weak Russians are beating us.</String>
		<String _locID="47400">We are losing, despite the weakness of the Spanish.</String>
		<String _locID="47401">How can we do better against these weak Aztecs?</String>
		<String _locID="47402">We must try harder against these weaker Iroquois.</String>
		<String _locID="47403">I know the Sioux are strong, but our armies should be stronger.</String>
		<String _locID="47404">You have the strength of a bear, but we are still behind.</String>
		<String _locID="47405">I cannot win alone. You must summon more strength.</String>
		<String _locID="47406">Our strength is superior to our enemies.</String>
		<String _locID="47407">The spirits seem to favor you. You are very strong.</String>
		<String _locID="47408">We appear to be ahead, but I need you to find more strength.</String>
		<String _locID="47409">It appears our enemies have bested us this day.</String>
		<String _locID="47410">Your spirit is strong, but I fear the battle is over.</String>
		<String _locID="47411">You are foolish to drag your people into senseless battles. Let us make peace.</String>
		<String _locID="47412">Call your warriors! We need to destroy our enemy's trading posts.</String>
		<String _locID="47413">Our enemy is wise to seek the aid of the locals.</String>
		<String _locID="47414">Our enemy seeks to bolster his economy with a trading post.</String>
		<String _locID="47415">Our enemy continues to seek help from the locals.</String>
		<String _locID="47416">It seems our enemy has gained the advantage in Trading Posts.</String>
		<String _locID="47417">I will ask my brothers for help.</String>
		<String _locID="47418">I will take a Trading Post to help our economies.</String>
		<String _locID="47419">A fine move getting ahead in Treasures.</String>
		<String _locID="47420">That treasure will help us to destroy our enemies.</String>
		<String _locID="47421">Use that wealth to train some warriors.</String>
		<String _locID="47422">That food will help feed your warriors.</String>
		<String _locID="47423">You would seem to be very familiar with these lands, but don't let those treasures distract you.</String>
		<String _locID="47424">I'll forgive that, but don't steal from my people again.</String>
		<String _locID="47425">I see you have found a warrior to help you.</String>
		<String _locID="47426">The Sioux welcome those villagers as their own.</String>
		<String _locID="47427">That wood will help you to expand your town.</String>
		<String _locID="47428">You are wise to keep us ahead of their Native settlements.</String>
		<String _locID="47429">That extra trading post will give us an economic advantage.</String>
		<String _locID="47430">I hope those walls are strong. They could never keep out my people.</String>
		<String _locID="47431">I know the power of these people. They will help us in our struggle.</String>
		<String _locID="47432">Now I have the first trading post. It will be easy for the council to get supplies to me.</String>
		<String _locID="47433">This will help me to crush our enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="47434">This coin will pay for many warriors.</String>
		<String _locID="47435">More food for my people.</String>
		<String _locID="47436">I know that you did not need this treasure.</String>
		<String _locID="47437">What is your war chief doing? He should be out gathering treasures.</String>
		<String _locID="47438">See how the Natives flock to our cause?</String>
		<String _locID="47439">These villagers will help our cause.</String>
		<String _locID="47440">This wood will help to build my settlement.</String>
		<String _locID="47441">More Natives will help us out.</String>
		<String _locID="47442">Another trading post has been added to our tribe.</String>
		<String _locID="47443">These walls will help to defend my people.</String>
		<String _locID="47444">The stage is set. Prepare to defend these posts to the last man.</String>
		<String _locID="47445">What has happened? You used to be a better leader.</String>
		<String _locID="47446">You have been busy. Your people must be proud.</String>
		<String _locID="47447">I see you have fought many battles since the last time we met.</String>
		<String _locID="47448">Though time is short, you have no idea where I will attack.</String>
		<String _locID="47449">Where is your strength now? We are about to destroy you.</String>
		<String _locID="47450">These combined forces can only mean victory for us.</String>
		<String _locID="47451">Your skill is impressive. I was sure I had won.</String>
		<String _locID="47452">See how easily I crush your inferior warriors.</String>
		<String _locID="47453">A fine choice, facing my superior warriors.</String>
		<String _locID="47454">Do you see how we are united against you?</String>
		<String _locID="47455">Do you not have the courage to face me alone?</String>
		<String _locID="47456">What spirit is helping you, that you are able to advance in age so quickly?</String>
		<String _locID="47457">You are wise to seek help from the locals, but you will still be defeated.</String>
		<String _locID="47458">That will not help you. My brothers are united against you.</String>
		<String _locID="47459">You can burn my town, but we will melt into the wilderness and strike back at you.</String>
		<String _locID="47460">That trading post was not needed.</String>
		<String _locID="47461">It is unwise to linger in the first age. You will have nothing to defend yourself with against my warriors.</String>
		<String _locID="47462">You are falling behind. Please, construct a town worthy for my warriors to destroy.</String>
		<String _locID="47463">So many resources wasted so soon. Are you up to something?</String>
		<String _locID="47464">I hope your ally is able to support you both, since it is obvious you are wasting resources.</String>
		<String _locID="47465">You are confident to think you will not need your ally's help against my warriors.</String>
		<String _locID="47466">You can build next to your ally's town. It will not help you.</String>
		<String _locID="47467">You must be very desperate now that your plans have been stopped.</String>
		<String _locID="47468">It makes me feel good to lift the yoke off my Native brothers.</String>
		<String _locID="47469">Feel the might of the Sioux.</String>
		<String _locID="47470">Another eyesore removed from the plains.</String>
		<String _locID="47471">I promise you an honorable death.</String>
		<String _locID="47472">It seems you think you are ready for a bigger challenge.</String>
		<String _locID="47473">It appears you are still stinging from the last time we played.</String>
		<String _locID="47474">I know these lands well. The advantage is mine.</String>
		<String _locID="47475">The bleeding you suffered last time seems to have taught you a lesson.</String>
		<String _locID="47476">You have much confidence, taking on a bigger enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="47477">Your braves cling so close to your war chief. They look scared to be outside your town.</String>
		<String _locID="47478">Your warriors seem to be lost.</String>
		<String _locID="47479">Come closer. My warriors do not want to travel far to slaughter your army.</String>
		<String _locID="47480">Coward! You kill women instead of my superior warriors.</String>
		<String _locID="47481">That is an admirable force, but what good are soldiers without a leader?</String>
		<String _locID="47482">I see some children have wandered away from your camp.</String>
		<String _locID="47483">The spirits favor you with stealth.</String>
		<String _locID="47484">Some of your men are lost. Just like their chief.</String>
		<String _locID="47485">So that is where you plan to die.</String>
		<String _locID="47486">A valiant fight, but that is not yours to take.</String>
		<String _locID="47487">Watch how my warriors appear out of nowhere.</String>
		<String _locID="47488">Things are quiet out there. My warriors could be anywhere.</String>
		<String _locID="47489">I do not know how, but you were the better war chief today.</String>
		<String _locID="47490">You were lucky this time, but we will rebuild.</String>
		<String _locID="47491">Why do you continue to plead with Natives? Are your own soldiers so bad?</String>
		<String _locID="47492">You may have more trading posts, but that only means more glory for my warriors.</String>
		<String _locID="47493">You have the speed of a bird, but your bones are just as brittle.</String>
		<String _locID="47494">No amount of treasure will keep my warriors out of your town.</String>
		<String _locID="47495">You are greedy, like all our enemies.</String>
		<String _locID="47496">Eat that food quickly, you will soon be choking on my tomahawk.</String>
		<String _locID="47497">All the treasures in these lands will not keep me from spilling your blood.</String>
		<String _locID="47498">Your war chief is a long way from home. I hope he knows his way back.</String>
		<String _locID="47499">It won't be long before your Native allies have realized that they are on the wrong side.</String>
		<String _locID="47500">Keep those people safe, or they will become part of my tribe.</String>
		<String _locID="47501">No amount of wood will keep my warriors out of your town.</String>
		<String _locID="47502">Walls mean nothing to the Sioux. We will be in your town before you wake to the danger.</String>
		<String _locID="47503">My tribe grows while yours sits idle.</String>
		<String _locID="47504">See how quickly the influence of my people spreads across the land.</String>
		<String _locID="47505">The power of my people grows with every passing second.</String>
		<String _locID="47506">This wealth will buy many warriors.</String>
		<String _locID="47507">More food to feed my people.</String>
		<String _locID="47508">There is much treasure to be found around your base. I'm sure you don't want it.</String>
		<String _locID="47509">My treasures pile up, yet you have so few. Is something wrong?</String>
		<String _locID="47510">My tribe grows with more powerful warriors.</String>
		<String _locID="47511">See how the people flock to my tribe.</String>
		<String _locID="47512">This wood will build many huts to house my warriors.</String>
		<String _locID="47513">The locals here will soon learn that they have joined the wrong side. Do not count on their help.</String>
		<String _locID="47514">You waste your time and resources on ugly buildings. My people will burn them to the ground.</String>
		<String _locID="47515">You do not scare me with these tactics. My warriors will soon put an end to this.</String>
		<String _locID="47516">My tribe's influence is all over the map. You do not have the power to stop me.</String>
		<String _locID="47517">It would appear that another opponent has been drawing your blood. Now it is my turn.</String>
		<String _locID="47518">It seems you have been fighting less worthy opponents. Now I will give you a true lesson.</String>
		<String _locID="47519">You have been practicing, but wisely not against me.</String>
		<String _locID="47520">More sacrifices! The enemy is close to winning!</String>
		<String _locID="47521">Cuauhtemoc will play tlachtli with your head if he loses.</String>
		<String _locID="47522">Cuauhtemoc's treasure is not at the bottom of the lake. Pay no attention when he tells this to the enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="47523">The gods are pleased with the blood Cuauhtemoc has spilled for them. Victory will soon be ours.</String>
		<String _locID="47524">The mighty Aztecs do not need artillery. But you do.</String>
		<String _locID="47525">Unlike us, you will need siege weapons to destroy the foe. Build artillery.</String>
		<String _locID="47526">Train more cavalry. Cuauhtemoc's warriors like the strange, hornless deer.</String>
		<String _locID="47527">The mighty Aztecs run their enemies down on foot. But you must train cavalry if you wish to do the same.</String>
		<String _locID="47528">You waste blood in that fight - you need more infantry.</String>
		<String _locID="47529">The Aztec Empire is built on infantry and blood. Train more foot warriors.</String>
		<String _locID="47530">If you insist on sacrificing your warriors, please do so at the temple.</String>
		<String _locID="47531">Retreat -- you waste your warriors on the battlefield!</String>
		<String _locID="47532">The stones of the battlefield drink the life of your army. Run away until you are stronger.</String>
		<String _locID="47533">The battle you enter will be bloody, and while Cuauhtemoc relishes blood, he relishes victory more.</String>
		<String _locID="47534">Retreat, the gods are not nourished when your blood is spilt on the battlefield.</String>
		<String _locID="47535">Good, our enemies gather together so that we may slaughter them all at once.</String>
		<String _locID="47536">Let the blood of our warriors and our foes mix and nourish the gods.</String>
		<String _locID="47537">Cuauhtemoc has never garlanded so many so quickly.</String>
		<String _locID="47539">Cuauhtemoc has captured many enemies for sacrifice.</String>
		<String _locID="47540">An easy victory. More blood for the gods of the Aztecs.</String>
		<String _locID="47541">Cuauhtemoc has turned defeat into triumph again!</String>
		<String _locID="47542">Our enemies were like the stars, but Cuauhtemoc waded through blood to earn his victory.</String>
		<String _locID="47543">The gods favor those who make sacrifice to them. Many lives were lost in that fight.</String>
		<String _locID="47544">That fight was too fast. Cuauhtemoc lacked time to capture sacrifices.</String>
		<String _locID="47545">Many went to the afterlife, but Cuauhtemoc prevailed.</String>
		<String _locID="47546">Cuauhtemoc will have many sacrifices after this battle.</String>
		<String _locID="47547">After Cuauhtemoc's victory, he celebrates!</String>
		<String _locID="47549">The pipiltin called Cuauhtemoc away for this?!</String>
		<String _locID="47550">Cuauhtemoc will crush our enemies in the coming battle.</String>
		<String _locID="47551">After the enemy throw themselves on Aztec blades, Cuauhtemoc will return to the temple.</String>
		<String _locID="47552">The battle turns. Cuauhtemoc thanks you.</String>
		<String _locID="47553">Cuauhtemoc is glad your army arrived. He was beginning to consider the knife for himself.</String>
		<String _locID="47554">They enemy bands together! They fear Cuauhtemoc - and they should!</String>
		<String _locID="47556">Cuauhtemoc shall.</String>
		<String _locID="47557">Yes.</String>
		<String _locID="47558">Of course.</String>
		<String _locID="47559">Cuauhtemoc agrees.</String>
		<String _locID="47560">Artillery? What is this 'artillery' you speak of?</String>
		<String _locID="47561">Cuauhtemoc will comply as best he can.</String>
		<String _locID="47562">What need have Aztecs for artillery? Cuauhtemoc will show you a different kind of 'artillery.'</String>
		<String _locID="47563">You joke with Cuauhtemoc, yes? The Aztecs ride no beasts.</String>
		<String _locID="47564">Cuauhtemoc will send his fastest warriors.</String>
		<String _locID="47565">Cavalry? The Aztecs do not borrow the strength of beasts.</String>
		<String _locID="47566">Of course Cuauhtemoc will train infantry.</String>
		<String _locID="47567">Infantry? What else from the Aztecs?</String>
		<String _locID="47568">What else could Cuauhtemoc train except infantry?</String>
		<String _locID="47569">Cuauhtemoc does not like to share.</String>
		<String _locID="47570">Cuauhtemoc's people come first.</String>
		<String _locID="47571">Cuauhtemoc gives up nothing.</String>
		<String _locID="47572">Leave Cuauhtemoc alone.</String>
		<String _locID="47573">Rodents and worms have eaten our supplies. Dark times are ahead.</String>
		<String _locID="47574">Even Cuauhtemoc cannot do so.</String>
		<String _locID="47575">Ask Cuauhtemoc again in 52 years.</String>
		<String _locID="47576">Cuauhtemoc refuses.</String>
		<String _locID="47577">Cuauhtemoc's warriors labor in the fields... they cannot fight now.</String>
		<String _locID="47578">No warriors can be spared. Cuauhtemoc has... religious matters to attend to.</String>
		<String _locID="47579">There is unrest in the Empire. Cuauhtemoc can spare no warriors.</String>
		<String _locID="47580">This is prevented by happenings beyond even Cuauhtemoc's power.</String>
		<String _locID="47581">Cuauhtemoc would, but greater forces prevent it.</String>
		<String _locID="47582">The greater law does not allow Cuauhtemoc to do this.</String>
		<String _locID="47583">Cuauhtemoc's warriors have bled out their lives. Their corpses would be of little use to you.</String>
		<String _locID="47584">Cuauhtemoc does not have enough warriors to send.</String>
		<String _locID="47585">Ask again later, Cuauhtemoc may have soldiers for you then.</String>
		<String _locID="47586">Bah! They have destroyed a Trading Post. They will pay in blood!</String>
		<String _locID="47587">Close... so close.</String>
		<String _locID="47588">Soon the rebel Aztec leader will grovel at Cuauhtemoc's feet, begging for merciful death.</String>
		<String _locID="47589">We will grind the British into dust, like so much corn.</String>
		<String _locID="47590">Gold cannot save the Dutch from the wrath of Cuauhtemoc.</String>
		<String _locID="47591">The French will find that Cuauhtemoc is merciless.</String>
		<String _locID="47592">The blood of Iroquois warriors will soon redden the temple steps.</String>
		<String _locID="47593">Cuauhtemoc will feed the heaps of Ottoman corpses to his menagerie.</String>
		<String _locID="47594">Cuauhtemoc will crush the Portuguese!</String>
		<String _locID="47595">The Russian hordes could not hope to bear up under the might of the Aztecs.</String>
		<String _locID="47596">The Sioux and their famous 'horses' will soon be finished.</String>
		<String _locID="47597">The Spanish could never hope to defeat Emperor Cuauhtemoc and the Aztecs.</String>
		<String _locID="47598">These traitor Aztecs are stronger than Cuauhtemoc expected.</String>
		<String _locID="47599">Cuauhtemoc blames you for letting the British thrive.</String>
		<String _locID="47600">How did the Dutch become so powerful? Do they also make sacrifices to the gods?</String>
		<String _locID="47601">The French do well. Cuauhtemoc can not tolerate this.</String>
		<String _locID="47602">Who would expect such strength from the Germans? Not Cuauhtemoc.</String>
		<String _locID="47603">The Iroquois surprise Cuauhtemoc with their strength.</String>
		<String _locID="47604">The Ottomans are strong... it must be their coffee.</String>
		<String _locID="47605">The Portuguese are stronger than expected. Good, Cuauhtemoc needed a challenge.</String>
		<String _locID="47606">Cuauhtemoc has learned that the only thing worse than Russians are more Russians.</String>
		<String _locID="47607">Cuauhtemoc must admit, the Sioux seem strong in deed.</String>
		<String _locID="47608">Even when the Spanish are few, they are powerful.</String>
		<String _locID="47609">You advance quickly. Cuauhtemoc should not have lingered so long over his rituals.</String>
		<String _locID="47610">Cuauhtemoc must spill blood to catch up. Blood!</String>
		<String _locID="47611">Who are you to advance so quickly - a descendent of Quetzalcoatl?</String>
		<String _locID="47612">Our enemy seeks allies here. It will end badly. Trust Cuauhtemoc.</String>
		<String _locID="47613">Alliances are fragile. Cuauhtemoc is not concerned that our enemy trusts in them.</String>
		<String _locID="47614">Cuauhtemoc trusts no one but himself. Let our enemy forge his foolish alliances.</String>
		<String _locID="47615">Our enemy has created an alliance for us to break.</String>
		<String _locID="47616">There are no warriors in the first Age. Warriors bring death. Death wins wars!</String>
		<String _locID="47617">You have spent long enough in the first Age.</String>
		<String _locID="47618">Advance in Age or be crushed like an overripe melon.</String>
		<String _locID="47619">You are too slow to be worthy of life. Advance or die.</String>
		<String _locID="47620">Advance in Age soon - Cuauhtemoc can carry you no longer.</String>
		<String _locID="47621">Soon it will be too late. Advance or die.</String>
		<String _locID="47622">If you have no use for your villagers, send them to Cuauhtemoc. He has ideas for them.</String>
		<String _locID="47623">Why are you so far behind Cuauhtemoc?</String>
		<String _locID="47624">You are too fast for us all. Cuauhtemoc is yet mired in the first Age.</String>
		<String _locID="47625">Be careful. He who rushes forward exposes his back.</String>
		<String _locID="47626">Good. Soon you will have many warriors to bring death to our enemies. You are training warriors, yes?</String>
		<String _locID="47627">The omens in the sky whisper of your greatness.</String>
		<String _locID="47628">You are the first to advance in Age. Now death shall reign among our foes.</String>
		<String _locID="47629">Finally you have caught up with Cuauhtemoc.</String>
		<String _locID="47630">You had better not be so slow again. Cuauhtemoc cannot always protect you.</String>
		<String _locID="47631">You are slower than the sloth in Cuauhtemoc's menagerie.</String>
		<String _locID="47632">Finally. Does your heart beat as slowly as you advance in Age?</String>
		<String _locID="47633">Cuauhtemoc will make sacrifices in your name so you can advance in Age more quickly next time.</String>
		<String _locID="47634">Cuauhtemoc has saved us all. You are welcome.</String>
		<String _locID="47635">They are broken! Now Cuauhtemoc goes for the throat.</String>
		<String _locID="47636">No alliances! Cuauhtemoc does not allow them!</String>
		<String _locID="47637">Cuauhtemoc has broken the enemy Native alliance here.</String>
		<String _locID="47638">Now these Natives may consider an alliance with Cuauhtemoc. He would like that. Very much.</String>
		<String _locID="47639">Out! Out! Cuauhtemoc has chased the enemy from this village.</String>
		<String _locID="47640">Cuauhtemoc tastes the destruction...</String>
		<String _locID="47641">Cuauhtemoc reigns over this ruin in darkness and smoke.</String>
		<String _locID="47642">Smoke and fire! Our enemies flee Cuauhtemoc.</String>
		<String _locID="47643">Cuauhtemoc will take many captives from the enemy colony.</String>
		<String _locID="47644">Cuauhtemoc's warriors dance in the rubble of our enemy's town. Slay them, my warriors! Slay!</String>
		<String _locID="47645">They shall not trade here anymore. So says Cuauhtemoc, Emperor of the Aztecs.</String>
		<String _locID="47646">There can be no trade if Cuauhtemoc forbids it.</String>
		<String _locID="47647">Come! Build a Trading Post here. Cuauhtemoc commands it.</String>
		<String _locID="47648">Why did the enemy fools think that any would want the goods peddled here?</String>
		<String _locID="47649">If a building can be sacrificed, Cuauhtemoc has sacrificed this Trading Post.</String>
		<String _locID="47650">Bah... Cuauhtemoc could not destroy our enemy's alliance with this tribe.</String>
		<String _locID="47651">Cuauhtemoc must regroup to attack the Trading Post in the Native village again.</String>
		<String _locID="47652">Emperor Cuauhtemoc cannot be defeated... yet he was.</String>
		<String _locID="47653">Cuauhtemoc has discovered that our enemy's buildings are protected by dark magic.</String>
		<String _locID="47654">Unbelievable. This Trading Post somehow survived Cuauhtemoc's attacks.</String>
		<String _locID="47655">When will this Trading Post fall to the might of the Aztec Empire?</String>
		<String _locID="47656">What incompetence! Cuauhtemoc's war chief has fallen.</String>
		<String _locID="47657">Someone or something has slain Cuauhtemoc's war chief. The gods found him unworthy.</String>
		<String _locID="47658">The water is bitter. Our food is bitter. Nothing can save Cuauhtemoc.</String>
		<String _locID="47659">Send an army here or you will find only gloriously-fallen Aztec corpses.</String>
		<String _locID="47660">The city is in flame. All is darkness and destruction. Can even you save Cuauhtemoc?</String>
		<String _locID="47661">Quick! Send your armies to Cuauhtemoc's city!</String>
		<String _locID="47662">Cuauhtemoc's city shall soon fall. When it does, your city may follow.</String>
		<String _locID="47663">I am Cuauhtemoc. Cuauhtemoc is the Aztec Empire.</String>
		<String _locID="47664">I am Emperor Cuauhtemoc. The Aztecs stand ready to conquer.</String>
		<String _locID="47665">Cuauhtemoc does not want to hear your cries when the enemies attack with fury in their hearts.</String>
		<String _locID="47666">Perhaps easier enemies shall be more to your taste. They certainly are to Cuauhtemoc's...</String>
		<String _locID="47667">How have you been since last we met? Since you crushed Cuauhtemoc's people under your heel.</String>
		<String _locID="47668">Cuauhtemoc bows before no one save the gods... are you their messenger?</String>
		<String _locID="47669">Hmmm... Cuauhtemoc wonders if you will be better now than when last we met.</String>
		<String _locID="47670">Cuauhtemoc can not carry you this time. Stand on your own or die.</String>
		<String _locID="47671">We do like battling here, don't we?</String>
		<String _locID="47672">The blood spilled this time had better not be Cuauhtemoc's.</String>
		<String _locID="47673">Once more we bring battle and bloodshed to our enemies! Death!</String>
		<String _locID="47674">My war chief has returned, like Quetzalcoatl. But without the fangs. Or feathers. Or divinity.</String>
		<String _locID="47675">Their colony is undefended! Strike now, while their bellies are exposed!</String>
		<String _locID="47676">Cuauhtemoc sees no army in the enemy city. Perhaps they have all been fed to the gods?</String>
		<String _locID="47677">The enemy has not built any barracks... either they are foolish or they have built it elsewhere. Cuauhtemoc suspects they are foolish.</String>
		<String _locID="47678">There is no barracks here. Why anyone would not want Infantry mystifies Cuauhtemoc.</String>
		<String _locID="47679">The scouts of Cuauhtemoc have found no stable. Our enemy may have given up on the strange horse-beasts.</String>
		<String _locID="47680">Cuauhtemoc sees no stable. Good. Those 'horses' make Cuauhtemoc... nervous.</String>
		<String _locID="47681">Take this gold. Do not waste it.</String>
		<String _locID="47682">Do not waste this gold.</String>
		<String _locID="47683">Gold from the coffers of the Aztecs.</String>
		<String _locID="47684">Gold, jade, and furs. These will bring you Coin.</String>
		<String _locID="47685">This tribute is backwards. You should be sending Coin to Cuauhtemoc.</String>
		<String _locID="47686">Grain, fruit and cocoa for Cuauhtemoc's friend.</String>
		<String _locID="47687">Cuauhtemoc has sent you a treat - the flesh of captured warriors. Ha! Cuauhtemoc makes a joke!</String>
		<String _locID="47688">A gift of food. Could you spare a villager to assist in a teeny-tiny sacrifice that Cuauhtemoc needs to make? A small one will do.</String>
		<String _locID="47689">Cuauhtemoc is unaccustomed to sending tribute. Here - take your filthy food.</String>
		<String _locID="47690">Take these animal carcasses. They are bled dry.</String>
		<String _locID="47691">Here is some wood. Cuauhtemoc builds in stone.</String>
		<String _locID="47692">Here is some wood. Carve Cuauhtemoc a mask. What? You use it for buildings? For weapons? What a waste.</String>
		<String _locID="47693">What need does Cuauhtemoc have of mere Wood? Take it.</String>
		<String _locID="47694">After you get this wood, have your carpenters make a tzompantli so you may display your skulls.</String>
		<String _locID="47695">Wood for your fires and your buildings. But especially your fires!</String>
		<String _locID="47696">Cuauhtemoc's heart beats strongly - he marches to war!</String>
		<String _locID="47697">Cuauhtemoc will capture many for sacrifice after the coming battle.</String>
		<String _locID="47698">Cuauhtemoc can already hear the screaming...</String>
		<String _locID="47699">Aztec muscle will flatten this base as if it had never been.</String>
		<String _locID="47700">Watch the settlers flee... run settlers run! You cannot escape the knife of Cuauhtemoc!</String>
		<String _locID="47701">There will be nothing but smoldering grass and rubble when Cuauhtemoc is done with the enemy's town.</String>
		<String _locID="47702">Aztec thews will reduce the enemy's town to rubble. And its people to corpses - or captives!</String>
		<String _locID="47703">Cuauhtemoc no longer suffers the alliance of this minor tribe with our enemies.</String>
		<String _locID="47704">Burn! Burn! There can be no trade without Cuauhtemoc's consent. Burn!</String>
		<String _locID="47705">Cuauhtemoc does not trust your wisdom, but he shall fight alongside you.</String>
		<String _locID="47706">Cuauhtemoc thinks your ranks look a little thin. His warriors will come to fill them out.</String>
		<String _locID="47707">Cuauhtemoc does not want to miss the coming bloodshed. Wait for his army!</String>
		<String _locID="47708">The Aztec armies will group here. Get out of the way.</String>
		<String _locID="47709">The walls of Tenochtitlan are bursting... Cuauhtemoc is founding a new city.</String>
		<String _locID="47710">Begin the songs and music to bless the new city of the Aztecs!</String>
		<String _locID="47711">I shall make a great ritual! My new city can not bless itself!</String>
		<String _locID="47712">Though he has been burned in the past, Cuauhtemoc shall attempt an alliance with the Natives here.</String>
		<String _locID="47713">Cuauhtemoc will speak with these Natives. If they do not agree to ally with him he shall slay... er... he means that he will ask again, nicely.</String>
		<String _locID="47714">Cocoa, fine cloth, precious metals... sacrificial animals... all for sale at this new Trading Post.</String>
		<String _locID="47715">Cuauhtemoc thinks it is time the world beheld the splendors of the Aztecs. He shall construct a Trading Post.</String>
		<String _locID="47716">Cuauhtemoc's soldiers shall defend this building. Or die trying.</String>
		<String _locID="47717">Cuauhtemoc will defend this building no matter how many lives it costs.</String>
		<String _locID="47718">Cuauhtemoc will hold this area for 52 years!</String>
		<String _locID="47719">Cuauhtemoc's warriors shall fight here. They shall die here. Cuauhtemoc himself shall die here if he must.</String>
		<String _locID="47720">Cuauhtemoc fights for this alliance. These Natives have proven loyal. Their hearts are strong.</String>
		<String _locID="47721">Cuauhtemoc shall not let the enemy sabotage his alliance with these Natives.</String>
		<String _locID="47722">The enemy shall not set foot into this town until the last of Cuauhtemoc's warriors are dead.</String>
		<String _locID="47723">Cuauhtemoc shall defend this town until the sun no longer rises.</String>
		<String _locID="47724">Mighty Cuauhtemoc does not need the goods traded here, but he shall not deprive you of them.</String>
		<String _locID="47725">This Trading Post shall stand. So says Cuauhtemoc, Lord of the Aztecs.</String>
		<String _locID="47726">Coin? Take it. What do the gods care for gold? They want lives!</String>
		<String _locID="47727">My people, we will send gold to our ally. So says Cuauhtemoc, Emperor of the Aztecs.</String>
		<String _locID="47728">Warriors toiled long in the fields for this food. Do not waste what Cuauhtemoc sends you.</String>
		<String _locID="47729">The chinampas overflow with food. Cuauhtemoc shall send you his leftovers.</String>
		<String _locID="47730">Cuauhtemoc requires little Wood. You may have what he does not need.</String>
		<String _locID="47731">Cuauhtemoc's people will be cold tonight.</String>
		<String _locID="47732">Cuauhtemoc's warriors rush to battle. The thunder you hear is their feet!</String>
		<String _locID="47733">Cuauhtemoc sends all the warriors he can spare!</String>
		<String _locID="47734">So many sacrifices, so little time.</String>
		<String _locID="47735">If you had to choose between your own life and the sun never rising again, which would you choose? Cuauhtemoc is not evil. He allows others to be selfless.</String>
		<String _locID="47736">Come to the next renewal ceremony, Cuauhtemoc will  spare no expense to... entertain you.</String>
		<String _locID="47737">Sometimes Cuauhtemoc imagines that he controls little men, no bigger than his thumb. He makes them scurry and fight and die. Cuauhtemoc needs to lay off the Ololiuhqui.</String>
		<String _locID="47738">Cuauhtemoc needs gold. Send Cuauhtemoc coin!</String>
		<String _locID="47739">Send Cuauhtemoc whatever coin you feel he is worthy of. He will not be at all angry if it is too little... not angry at all...</String>
		<String _locID="47740">Food... Cuauhtemoc hungers!</String>
		<String _locID="47741">Food! Cuauhtemoc demands a feast of food!</String>
		<String _locID="47742">Cuauhtemoc needs wood to build a fire on the chest of a warrior sacrifice.</String>
		<String _locID="47743">Cuauhtemoc needs wood to burn sacrifices-- er... to build buildings and weapons.</String>
		<String _locID="47744">Cuauhtemoc is grateful for your help in slaying our hated enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="47745">Cuauhtemoc had the situation well in hand. He needed no help.</String>
		<String _locID="47746">Cuauhtemoc did not ask for your help.</String>
		<String _locID="47747">Cuauhtemoc shall not waste this gift of coin.</String>
		<String _locID="47748">This food shall nourish Cuauhtemoc's people. Cuauhtemoc thanks you.</String>
		<String _locID="47749">The Aztec people are grateful for your assistance.</String>
		<String _locID="47750">Finally you arrive. If you had not shown up when you did, Cuauhtemoc would have been finished.</String>
		<String _locID="47751">Cuauhtemoc did not need your warriors. But since they have marched so far it would be a shame for them to leave.</String>
		<String _locID="47752">Cuauhtemoc, Emperor of the mighty Aztecs, thanks you for your fitting tribute.</String>
		<String _locID="47753">Ahh.... Good. This wood will burn in the hearths of the Aztecs. The fire god will be pleased.</String>
		<String _locID="47754">No! It can't be! No traitor Aztec chieftain could defeat Emperor Cuauhtemoc!</String>
		<String _locID="47755">Bah! The British! Cuauhtemoc spits on them!</String>
		<String _locID="47756">These Dutch, they are not all about Banks and trade...</String>
		<String _locID="47757">Cuauhtemoc hopes the French are as merciful as they are strong.</String>
		<String _locID="47758">How could we stop the Germans? Their uhlans run amuck!</String>
		<String _locID="47759">Cuauhtemoc fears that the Iroquois have more surprises in store.</String>
		<String _locID="47760">Strong artillery. Strong infantry. Even strong coffee! The Ottomans are unstoppable.</String>
		<String _locID="47761">The Portuguese crush us... Cuauhtemoc did not seek this much challenge.</String>
		<String _locID="47762">We are doomed by relentless Russians.</String>
		<String _locID="47763">The Sioux and their cursed steeds! We do not have long.</String>
		<String _locID="47764">Who would have expected the Spanish to defeat the Aztecs so easily?</String>
		<String _locID="47765">No! Cuauhtemoc refuses to believe his pathetic Aztec rival is beating him! It is not so!</String>
		<String _locID="47766">Cuauhtemoc has made sacrifice after sacrifice. And still the weak British prevail.</String>
		<String _locID="47767">How do the Dutch defeat Cuauhtemoc?</String>
		<String _locID="47768">The French are winning. The only answer to this humiliation is blood! More blood!</String>
		<String _locID="47769">Cuauhtemoc must not allow the Germans a victory. Though it may be out of his hands.</String>
		<String _locID="47770">The Iroquois slaughter us. Cuauhtemoc is unaccustomed to being on the pointy end of the knife.</String>
		<String _locID="47771">If the Ottomans were more powerful they could end this now. Instead they make Cuauhtemoc linger.</String>
		<String _locID="47772">How! How can the Portuguese beat us? With numbers? With gunpowder? Hmm... that is probably it.</String>
		<String _locID="47773">The Russians drown us, but how? Cuauhtemoc blames you.</String>
		<String _locID="47774">The Sioux are not worthy of beating Cuauhtemoc. Yet they do. Perhaps using these 'horses' is not so foolish after all.</String>
		<String _locID="47775">No! The Spanish are so few! How could they possibly defeat Cuauhtemoc?</String>
		<String _locID="47776">Cuauhtemoc can stomach no more blood. Cuauhtemoc is so funny. He loves blood. But we are losing.</String>
		<String _locID="47777">We are losing. How can a king be as weak as you?</String>
		<String _locID="47778">Blood flows down the temple steps! We are winning!</String>
		<String _locID="47779">Cuauhtemoc has concealed his power well. Now the victory seems like your doing. No thanks necessary.</String>
		<String _locID="47780">This victory is Cuauhtemoc's, but you may bask in his reflected glory.</String>
		<String _locID="47781">Come with Cuauhtemoc to the temple. It is time to end this war.</String>
		<String _locID="47782">Emperor Cuauhtemoc wishes to end it. The obsidian knife is ready.</String>
		<String _locID="47783">Cuauhtemoc can fight no longer. He will be unsuitable for sacrifice if the fighting continues.</String>
		<String _locID="47784">What will convince you to stop? Should Cuauhtemoc hand you the obsidian knife?</String>
		<String _locID="47785">Look - a glowing ear of corn in the sky - it sheds sparks like drops of blood... this is a sign. It is over.</String>
		<String _locID="47786">Cowards! They fear to face Cuauhtemoc's armies at the time of his choosing.</String>
		<String _locID="47787">The enemy allies with the Natives here. Cuauhtemoc cannot allow this.</String>
		<String _locID="47788">Cuauhtemoc refuses to let the enemy monopolize trade here.</String>
		<String _locID="47789">They build alliances with the Natives. They are out after Cuauhtemoc!</String>
		<String _locID="47790">Good. Cuauhtemoc's foes are denied that tribe's loyalty.</String>
		<String _locID="47791">Bah, why bother with Trading Posts?</String>
		<String _locID="47792">Your first treasure. Take it as Cuauhtemoc's gift.</String>
		<String _locID="47793">Cuauhtemoc thinks you are out to get all the treasures... yes... all the treasures.</String>
		<String _locID="47794">Cuauhtemoc could have used that coin.</String>
		<String _locID="47795">Cuauhtemoc could have used that food.</String>
		<String _locID="47796">Fine! Take all the treasures! Leave none for Cuauhtemoc!</String>
		<String _locID="47797">Thief! You steal from Cuauhtemoc!</String>
		<String _locID="47798">When you have no more use of that Native, send him to Cuauhtemoc.</String>
		<String _locID="47799">Villagers? Take them. Cuauhtemoc wants warriors.</String>
		<String _locID="47800">Cuauhtemoc could use that wood.</String>
		<String _locID="47801">The more Native tribes we ally with, the fewer our enemies have to turn against us.</String>
		<String _locID="47802">Cuauhtemoc hopes that you spending resources on your army too. Fruits and blankets make poor weapons.</String>
		<String _locID="47803">Walls? Do you fear Cuauhtemoc?</String>
		<String _locID="47804">Cuauhtemoc hopes that you have enough wood to train warriors after building that wall.</String>
		<String _locID="47805">Cuauhtemoc cannot leave the Natives here to ally with his enemies.</String>
		<String _locID="47806">The mighty Aztecs share their goods with the world.</String>
		<String _locID="47807">Cuauhtemoc finds treasure in the wilderness.</String>
		<String _locID="47808">Tribute for Cuauhtemoc!</String>
		<String _locID="47809">More tribute for Cuauhtemoc!</String>
		<String _locID="47810">This treasure in your town must be tribute for Cuauhtemoc.</String>
		<String _locID="47811">All the treasures of the wilderness are tribute to Cuauhtemoc and the Aztecs!</String>
		<String _locID="47812">Cuauhtemoc has rescued a Native, who will make a fine scout.</String>
		<String _locID="47813">Cuauhtemoc has rescued villagers...hist! Cuauhtemoc can hear their beating hearts.</String>
		<String _locID="47814">This wood will make fine maquahuitl.</String>
		<String _locID="47815">Cuauhtemoc cares not for alliances, but better Cuauhtemoc than his enemies.</String>
		<String _locID="47816">Cuauhtemoc, Emperor of the Aztecs, Master of Trade!</String>
		<String _locID="47817">Walls... the better to keep Cuauhtemoc's people safe.</String>
		<String _locID="47818">We will win if enough time passes - Cuauhtemoc shall begin offering hearts to the gods for our victory!</String>
		<String _locID="47819">No defeat is so great that it cannot be washed away by blood.</String>
		<String _locID="47820">Cuauhtemoc sees you have won battles since we met. He celebrates with a sacrifice!</String>
		<String _locID="47821">You grow more experienced with each battle. Cuauhtemoc offers thanks to the gods.</String>
		<String _locID="47822">One of these Trading Posts must fall!</String>
		<String _locID="47823">Cuauhtemoc will feed your souls to the hungry gods.</String>
		<String _locID="47824">Blood! More blood!</String>
		<String _locID="47825">Cuauhtemoc was wrong about you. You would make a fine sacrifice.</String>
		<String _locID="47826">Bah! Sacrifice at the temple is one thing, but on the battlefield...</String>
		<String _locID="47827">Cuauhtemoc cannot lose! This must be an evil dream sent by the gods.</String>
		<String _locID="47828">You are no challenge to mighty Cuauhtemoc.</String>
		<String _locID="47829">Cuauhtemoc can feel the blood of your people running down his arms already.</String>
		<String _locID="47830">You waste Cuauhtemoc's time!</String>
		<String _locID="47831">What made you think that battle was a good idea?</String>
		<String _locID="47832">Prepare yourself for death.</String>
		<String _locID="47833">Cuauhtemoc asks... do you prefer a slow death or a swift one?</String>
		<String _locID="47834">You may flee... Cuauhtemoc is not without mercy. Who is Cuauhtemoc kidding?</String>
		<String _locID="47835">Your warriors have turned the battle. Cuauhtemoc wonders what you shall demand for your help.</String>
		<String _locID="47836">Cuauhtemoc's enemies band together. They fear him!</String>
		<String _locID="47837">Rush headlong into death! Cuauhtemoc awaits.</String>
		<String _locID="47838">What? Already you advance in Age! This displeases Cuauhtemoc very much.</String>
		<String _locID="47839">Bah... Cuauhtemoc does not fear you, why should he fear your allies?</String>
		<String _locID="47840">Do not think you can turn these Natives against Cuauhtemoc!</String>
		<String _locID="47841">This town is destroyed, but Cuauhtemoc will find another lake and another cactus and another snake-eating eagle.</String>
		<String _locID="47842">Cuauhtemoc did not need that Trading Post.</String>
		<String _locID="47843">Are your people too frightened of Cuauhtemoc to advance in Age?</String>
		<String _locID="47844">You are still in the first Age? Perhaps Cuauhtemoc will ensure you never see the second one.</String>
		<String _locID="47845">Cuauhtemoc wonders why you cling to such primitive ways.</String>
		<String _locID="47846">Cuauhtemoc's warriors are stronger than yours. His farms are more productive. His carpenters are more skilled. What hope do you have?</String>
		<String _locID="47847">When you rush ahead, Cuauhtemoc has a good shot at your back.</String>
		<String _locID="47848">Young corn grows quickly. Cuauhtemoc will cut you down.</String>
		<String _locID="47849">Welcome to the wars. This is the Age where Cuauhtemoc will begin to destroy you.</String>
		<String _locID="47850">Aha! Cuauhtemoc told his ally you were still here. His ally did not believe him.</String>
		<String _locID="47851">Your town is far from everyone else... no one can hear your screams...</String>
		<String _locID="47852">Bah! After he crushes your town Cuauhtemoc has a long walk to destroy your allies.</String>
		<String _locID="47853">Ah... good. After Cuauhtemoc destroys your town he will not have far to march to finish your ally.</String>
		<String _locID="47854">Try again and fail - again! So says Cuauhtemoc.</String>
		<String _locID="47855">Cuauhtemoc cannot suffer these alliances to exist.</String>
		<String _locID="47856">Your colony is destroyed - Cuauhtemoc brings death to his enemies! And his friends.</String>
		<String _locID="47857">None may trade without Cuauhtemoc's say.</String>
		<String _locID="47858">I am Cuauhtemoc, Lord of all Aztecs. And you are not Quetzalcoatl.</String>
		<String _locID="47859">Ahhh...It is a fine day for Emperor Cuauhtemoc to nourish the gods by sacrificing your warriors.</String>
		<String _locID="47860">Kneel before Emperor Cuauhtemoc and he will let you choose the manner of your own death.</String>
		<String _locID="47861">I am Cuauhtemoc, Emperor of the Aztecs. Cuauhtemoc will enjoy placing your skull in the tzompantli.</String>
		<String _locID="47862">Last time we met, Cuauhtemoc was distracted. This time, he will cut you and your pathetic colony to ribbons.</String>
		<String _locID="47863">It is good to admit weakness. Perhaps you should just hand yourself over to Cuauhtemoc for sacrifice right now.</String>
		<String _locID="47864">You must enjoy spilling your blood in this land. So does Cuauhtemoc.</String>
		<String _locID="47865">Stacking the odds in your favor? Cuauhtemoc sees that your efforts are fruitless.</String>
		<String _locID="47866">What? Cuauhtemoc was not enough of a challenge? He does not need a new ally to defeat the likes of you!</String>
		<String _locID="47867">Cuauhtemoc's war chief returns. He lusts for vengeance.</String>
		<String _locID="47868">You will not gather many treasures with him.</String>
		<String _locID="47869">Cuauhtemoc has spotted your warriors. The gods thirst for their blood.</String>
		<String _locID="47870">No, no, the temple is over here. Attack near it so Cuauhtemoc will not have far to drag the bodies.</String>
		<String _locID="47871">Why do your warriors attack Cuauhtemoc? Has some war begun he did not know about?</String>
		<String _locID="47872">No one spills the blood of Cuauhtemoc's people except Cuauhtemoc!</String>
		<String _locID="47873">Cuauhtemoc sees you have come to negotiate your surrender.</String>
		<String _locID="47874">This army is too small to conquer me, but almost too large to capture for sacrifice. Almost.</String>
		<String _locID="47875">Your warriors scurry like insects in Cuauhtemoc's' city. Ow! Stinging insects!</String>
		<String _locID="47876">The blood of so few can only cause the sun to rise for a week or two. Send more.</String>
		<String _locID="47877">Cuauhtemoc has discovered your pathetic colony.</String>
		<String _locID="47878">Cuauhtemoc seeeeees yoooou.</String>
		<String _locID="47879">It is good of you to leave tribute for Cuauhtemoc. He will make your death as painless as he can.</String>
		<String _locID="47880">Cuauhtemoc cannot resist warning you of his attack so he may smell the fear in your sweat.</String>
		<String _locID="47881">That thunder? It is the blood rushing in your ears that you hear.</String>
		<String _locID="47882">The Aztec army comes. Surrender so that Cuauhtemoc can more easily take you to the waiting altar.</String>
		<String _locID="47883">Blood is power.</String>
		<String _locID="47884">A sign glows in the sky, an ear of corn shedding sparks like blood.</String>
		<String _locID="47885">There is always room for sacrifice.</String>
		<String _locID="47886">Cuauhtemoc concedes. The treasure of the Aztecs is at the bottom of the lake.</String>
		<String _locID="47887">Give Cuauhtemoc an honorable death so that his blood may nourish the gods and his flesh feed your menagerie.</String>
		<String _locID="47888">Come! End it!</String>
		<String _locID="47889">Before you cut down Cuauhtemoc's people, would you care to share a cup of chocolate?</String>
		<String _locID="47890">Burn the bridges! Pour the treasure into the lake! The Aztecs are finished.</String>
		<String _locID="47891">No! Cuauhtemoc will never surrender! Unless you let him...</String>
		<String _locID="47892">Cuauhtemoc did not shed enough blood to ensure victory. It is the end of all things.</String>
		<String _locID="47893">The Aztecs are defeated. Will the sun ever rise again?</String>
		<String _locID="47894">Cuauhtemoc underestimated your stubborn nature.</String>
		<String _locID="47895">Trade cannot save your pathetic colony.</String>
		<String _locID="47896">Scurry, scurry! Grab the treasures...</String>
		<String _locID="47897">Those treasures cannot save you from Cuauhtemoc's obsidian blade.</String>
		<String _locID="47898">You amass wealth. All the more for Cuauhtemoc when he conquers you.</String>
		<String _locID="47899">Yes, fatten yourselves up.</String>
		<String _locID="47900">Your collection of treasures may comfort you in the grave.</String>
		<String _locID="47901">Cuauhtemoc will enjoy making you pay for stealing that treasure.</String>
		<String _locID="47902">Be careful of treachery from those you protect.</String>
		<String _locID="47903">Run villagers! Run to your savior's colony!</String>
		<String _locID="47904">Gathering wood for your funeral pyre?</String>
		<String _locID="47905">Cuauhtemoc sees a wall. You are properly frightened.</String>
		<String _locID="47906">No wall can save you from Cuauhtemoc.</String>
		<String _locID="47907">The Aztecs are well known for their alliances with neighboring peoples.</String>
		<String _locID="47908">Cuauhtemoc claims all trade in this land.</String>
		<String _locID="47909">This land is ripe with treasures that belong to Emperor Cuauhtemoc.</String>
		<String _locID="47910">Mine!</String>
		<String _locID="47911">Glittering treasure!</String>
		<String _locID="47912">Cuauhtemoc hungers.</String>
		<String _locID="47913">Cuauhtemoc sees all. Steals all.</String>
		<String _locID="47914">Cuauhtemoc laughs at your sluggish treasure gathering.</String>
		<String _locID="47915">Cuauhtemoc loves the Natives of this land.</String>
		<String _locID="47916">These villagers are hearty. They will work hard.</String>
		<String _locID="47917">A cache of wood, the better to burn you with!</String>
		<String _locID="47918">In Cuauhtemoc's experience, such alliances can be deadly. Enjoy!</String>
		<String _locID="47919">A Trade Post. Now Cuauhtemoc knows where to find you.</String>
		<String _locID="47920">If you cannot defeat the mighty Aztecs on the battlefield, why do you think this will work?</String>
		<String _locID="47921">Good, my warriors like a challenge. It gets the blood up.</String>
		<String _locID="47922">Cuauhtemoc's victory is immanent. If you surrender now, you will have the honor to be the first at the altar.</String>
		<String _locID="47923">Cuauhtemoc opens the gates to his city so you may view its splendor as you die.</String>
		<String _locID="47924">Cuauhtemoc thinks that perhaps you have been seeking treasure at the bottom of a lake.</String>
		<String _locID="47925">You climb the steps to glory. Cuauhtemoc waits at the top.</String>
		<String _locID="47926">Do not imagine that Cuauhtemoc will cower just because you are more powerful than when he last faced you.</String>
		<String _locID="47927">Fear for us, O ally. Harm and evil come now near us!</String>
		<String _locID="47928">Better were it to go fasting than to bear this dreadful burden - we stand to lose in less than one minute.</String>
		<String _locID="47929">A monstrous story; we are but one minute from losing this war.</String>
		<String _locID="47930">Do not fear for me, O ally. Harm and evil shall come no more near us!</String>
		<String _locID="47931">By the shining water and the drifting grass lands, we shall win in less than one minute.</String>
		<String _locID="47932">From my brain the thought of vengeance, but from my heart the simple need for more siege.</String>
		<String _locID="47933">It would be a great achievement if you could bring more siege weapons to this battle.</String>
		<String _locID="47934">In these days of evil spirits, the fields of battle need more horsemen from you.</String>
		<String _locID="47935">We fight onward, in solemn manner, and need from you more horsed warriors.</String>
		<String _locID="47936">When I speak to the foe he trembles, the need in battle is for more foot warriors.</String>
		<String _locID="47937">Our war clubs are swinging, our foes are cracking, but to win the war we need more foot warriors from you.</String>
		<String _locID="47938">You are like a man from a dream awakened, only to face a terrible blow. Withdraw, my ally, withdraw.</String>
		<String _locID="47939">The shattered sky above us breaks! Do not join us in this doomed fight, my ally!</String>
		<String _locID="47940">A battle rages. The sky we tread beneath bends and throws itself in fury.</String>
		<String _locID="47941">We join and raise our fists against the heavens; a great battle rages here!</String>
		<String _locID="47942">The clouds are swept from heaven. By our hand the enemy has passed from the fields, as we expected.</String>
		<String _locID="47943">The tens and eights of our enemy have fallen in that battle, as I knew they would.</String>
		<String _locID="47944">We threw them on the ground before us, our foes in rows vanquished.</String>
		<String _locID="47945">A moody melancholy takes me, with this victory that once seemed unlikely.</String>
		<String _locID="47946">Curious eyes stare about us. How did we win that battle, which should have been a loss?</String>
		<String _locID="47947">In many games of skill and hazard, one would have to reach far to find a battle like this one. How did we win it?</String>
		<String _locID="47948">Mighty move our forces, our foe's heart shall be swept with ice.</String>
		<String _locID="47949">I enter this fray full of eagerness.</String>
		<String _locID="47950">This battle will be excellent, full of victory for us and defeat for them.</String>
		<String _locID="47951">We shall circle our foes with confidence. They shall lose this fight.</String>
		<String _locID="47952">Timely and potent your arrival. The tide of battle flows now in our favor.</String>
		<String _locID="47953">It is good you are back from your wanderings; you are needed to turn the flow of this battle.</String>
		<String _locID="47954">Enters through the door a burning firebrand; another foe has joined the fray.</String>
		<String _locID="47955">The enemy has seized the war club in this fray; we may fare poorly.</String>
		<String _locID="47956">Ay, we shall.</String>
		<String _locID="47957">This is where we agree, yes.</String>
		<String _locID="47958">On my nation, on my honor, yes.</String>
		<String _locID="47959">Ay, though panting under heavy burdens.</String>
		<String _locID="47960">Ay, the forges shall fire, the siege made.</String>
		<String _locID="47961">I shall build the siege weapons you need, ally.</String>
		<String _locID="47962">Ay, our horse riders shall tread, and the grasses bend.</String>
		<String _locID="47963">You shout for horse riders, and horse riders I shall give you!</String>
		<String _locID="47964">Beneath shaggy eyebrows, I gaze. Your horse riders are on their way.</String>
		<String _locID="47965">Ay, although to the land of ghosts and shadows they may walk, foot warriors we shall train.</String>
		<String _locID="47966">The foot warriors shall journey to your side.</String>
		<String _locID="47967">Yes. And loosely shall our foes be scattered, when my foot warriors arrive to help you.</String>
		<String _locID="47968">Our supplies and resources are little more than smoke wreaths. I cannot comply.</String>
		<String _locID="47969">My reserves are too low to meet your need, ally.</String>
		<String _locID="47970">I have not the food, wood, nor coin to help you.</String>
		<String _locID="47971">To your request, we cannot accede.</String>
		<String _locID="47972">The fallen leaves of last year... No.</String>
		<String _locID="47973">That shall not be possible.</String>
		<String _locID="47974">Nay. We cannot.</String>
		<String _locID="47975">Have your eyes been blinded by the dark and bright? I have no warriors to help you.</String>
		<String _locID="47976">You must find strength within. I lack an army to help you.</String>
		<String _locID="47977">Alas. I cannot. Better were it to go fasting than to bear such a heavy burden.</String>
		<String _locID="47978">Although the eyes of wolves glare at me, I cannot do that.</String>
		<String _locID="47979">My response must be lacking.</String>
		<String _locID="47980">My young soldiers are insufficient in number to meet your request.</String>
		<String _locID="47981">My forces are too depleted. No.</String>
		<String _locID="47982">I have too few warriors to help you now.</String>
		<String _locID="47983">Enemies have journeyed to one of our trading posts. It is laid to waste.</String>
		<String _locID="47984">We cannot win that way after all.</String>
		<String _locID="47985">The Aztecs have traveled a long and weary journey, but it looks now finally to be at a dark end.</String>
		<String _locID="47986">The Aztecs have almost been destroyed.</String>
		<String _locID="47987">Not so long and wide the world is... my wrath has reached the British empire!</String>
		<String _locID="47988">The British are almost gone, as ducks in the winter.</String>
		<String _locID="47989">If the powerful Dutch go on thus, we shall tear them to pieces.</String>
		<String _locID="47990">With fiery eyes and screaming, the Dutch fall before our war hatchets.</String>
		<String _locID="47991">For days the French have journeyed the pathways of the dead, and now they have reached their end.</String>
		<String _locID="47992">The French fought as well as they could, but are nearly lost.</String>
		<String _locID="47993">The Germans are almost gone to the land of ghosts and shadows.</String>
		<String _locID="47994">Their leadership in tatters, the Germans crumble before us.</String>
		<String _locID="47995">We see before us the false Iroquois, their warpath broken before them. They are all but defeated.</String>
		<String _locID="47996">Our false Iroquois foes are forced to the edge. They cannot fight much longer.</String>
		<String _locID="47997">The Ottoman foe passes now, heavy laden under our blows.</String>
		<String _locID="47998">The ravens tell me that nothing the Ottomans can do will save them now.</String>
		<String _locID="47999">The Portuguese tread the solitary path to defeat and ruin by our hand.</String>
		<String _locID="48000">Our Portuguese foe is falling. Soon his form will mingle with the crushed grass.</String>
		<String _locID="48001">Slowly vanish the Russian foes to the land of the hereafter.</String>
		<String _locID="48002">The Russians appear to have lost the war here.</String>
		<String _locID="48003">The earth shall be covered with silence; our foes are almost done with.</String>
		<String _locID="48004">The Sioux must return to their gloomy plains. We have nearly defeated them.</String>
		<String _locID="48005">To our Spanish foe lies now only a pathway to the lonely end.</String>
		<String _locID="48006">I see that the Spanish are doomed.</String>
		<String _locID="48007">How much power they bring to bear, the Aztec empire is thunder upon the soil.</String>
		<String _locID="48008">My eyes watch with awe. The Aztecs are a mighty foe.</String>
		<String _locID="48009">If outrageous Britain goes on thus, tearing everything to pieces, what becomes of us?</String>
		<String _locID="48010">It is a wonder that any nation has stood against our powerful British foe.</String>
		<String _locID="48011">Never stoops the soaring Dutch bird, mighty of wing and sword.</String>
		<String _locID="48012">The Dutch have a strength on the battlefield like a mountain bear.</String>
		<String _locID="48013">Disasters come not singly. The first descends from the French, but others will follow.</String>
		<String _locID="48014">A hawk with talons sharp and strong, the French descend with force most awesome.</String>
		<String _locID="48015">The powerful Germans have pressed us as if stooping over a ground bird's nest.</String>
		<String _locID="48016">We dare not taunt or provoke our German foe until we have grown as strong ourselves.</String>
		<String _locID="48017">Ever wakeful, ever watchful, the Iroquois warriors seem mightier than the trees.</String>
		<String _locID="48018">The Iroquois empire is mighty on the lands, moving like a strong river through the woods.</String>
		<String _locID="48019">There are corpses clad in garments, ghosts that come to haunt us. The Ottoman are a mighty foe.</String>
		<String _locID="48020">The Ottoman foe has great power in these lands. We dare not fight them too soon.</String>
		<String _locID="48021">We are thrown down before them. The Portuguese may tramp over our downed weapons with ease.</String>
		<String _locID="48022">The Portuguese are fierce sea hawks. They are not to be trifled with.</String>
		<String _locID="48023">The Russians laugh like water, their power in war rolls over the earth.</String>
		<String _locID="48024">Our foe from Russia has mighty hordes. Perhaps more than we can answer.</String>
		<String _locID="48025">Never once have the Sioux, by a movement of their troops or sign of might, appeared anything but strong.</String>
		<String _locID="48026">The Sioux might slay us, if we are not fully prepared for their strength.</String>
		<String _locID="48027">We strove to seize the finest land, but the Spanish press back and may win the day.</String>
		<String _locID="48028">The Spanish have great strength. Let us not be blinded to this truth.</String>
		<String _locID="48029">I endure in silence, as you journey up the ages ahead of me.</String>
		<String _locID="48030">You have climbed the great tree of time, advancing well before I could.</String>
		<String _locID="48031">Our enemy claims the rights of guest and stranger in these lands, taking a Native settlement.</String>
		<String _locID="48032">Our enemy has gone like fog off the water, and claimed a Native ally.</String>
		<String _locID="48033">You are late in your arrival to the Commerce Age, my ally.</String>
		<String _locID="48034">Are you waiting for the ducks to return for the summer?</String>
		<String _locID="48035">Do not weep in the silent midnight, instead make haste and advance to the next age.</String>
		<String _locID="48036">Stop drifting on the stream of time and advance to the next age.</String>
		<String _locID="48037">You have pushed aside the deerskin curtain, walking into the Commerce Age before anyone else.</String>
		<String _locID="48038">You have landed first on the shore of the Commerce Age.</String>
		<String _locID="48039">Has perchance my ally grown old, waiting to advance to the Commerce Age?</String>
		<String _locID="48040">It is good you have joined us in the Commerce Age, o slow one.</String>
		<String _locID="48041">Henceforward and forever, I shall speak to the winds my thanks to you.</String>
		<String _locID="48042">I cry aloud and speak like sunlight: you have rescued my war chief.</String>
		<String _locID="48043">I have moved heavily upon their trading post in time.</String>
		<String _locID="48044">The enemy were a threat, but I have torn their plans to bits.</String>
		<String _locID="48045">The trading post in the Native village has been struck down. Forthwith and forever.</String>
		<String _locID="48046">My warriors have struck. An enemy Native village has fallen like an dead tree.</String>
		<String _locID="48047">See the masses of the enemy, lying still in their valley.</String>
		<String _locID="48048">Dust and broken arrows alone remain, in the enemy town I have just visited.</String>
		<String _locID="48049">An enemy trading post has been destroyed, souls sent upon their journey.</String>
		<String _locID="48050">Hear me ally. I have crushed a trading post of our hated foes.</String>
		<String _locID="48051">The trading post at the Native village still stands, although our outrage moved upon it.</String>
		<String _locID="48052">The enemy was too strong. I could not invade that Native village.</String>
		<String _locID="48053">We did fail in the lesser trial; the enemy town still stands.</String>
		<String _locID="48054">We ran to ambush the enemy town, but we were forced back.</String>
		<String _locID="48055">I report to you news unpopular; the enemy trading post stands yet.</String>
		<String _locID="48056">My warriors moved with heat and silence but were unable to strike down that enemy trading post.</String>
		<String _locID="48057">Night approaches, let a grave be kindled. My war chief is dead.</String>
		<String _locID="48058">I cannot capture treasures from the wilderness without my war chief.</String>
		<String _locID="48059">A guardian in the wilderness has killed my war chief.</String>
		<String _locID="48060">My war chief has fallen early, defeated by a creature of the wilderness.</String>
		<String _locID="48061">I faint in the harder struggle, feel a looming darkness over our hope.</String>
		<String _locID="48062">The cold breath of fate flies to us. I cannot see how we can win.</String>
		<String _locID="48063">My warriors need help in this place.</String>
		<String _locID="48064">I need help in the distance. Here.</String>
		<String _locID="48065">I see my nation scattered, forgetful of my counsels. I plead my ally's help.</String>
		<String _locID="48066">Enemies swarm like bees in my town; too many to fight without help.</String>
		<String _locID="48067">I am as a guest in your wigwam, my ally.</String>
		<String _locID="48068">Greetings. We shall rise in power together, like the new moon.</String>
		<String _locID="48069">Together we shall send our foes to haunt the fen-lands.</String>
		<String _locID="48070">Oh the blasting of the fever! The wasting of the famine! The challenge you have set is terrible but fair.</String>
		<String _locID="48071">The challenge will be greater now.</String>
		<String _locID="48072">The hungry stars in heaven watch over our contest, set lower in difficulty than our last battle.</String>
		<String _locID="48073">You have changed the difficulty. You desired to float easier in the waters of war.</String>
		<String _locID="48074">We are allies now, but in our last contest you were as the great bear of the mountains, and defeated me.</String>
		<String _locID="48075">When we last met, you sent me to defeat, dark and lonely.</String>
		<String _locID="48076">Your score in our last meeting was exceptional. But we are allies now, and shall triumph as one force upon the land.</String>
		<String _locID="48077">In the last war we were allied, you fielded a mighty army. It was luminous.</String>
		<String _locID="48078">We were enemies, and the unseen spirits call out my victory. We were enemies but now fight as one.</String>
		<String _locID="48079">Allied forces we were in our last battle. But my score was the mightier by far.</String>
		<String _locID="48080">This realm looks familiar. These north winds sweep over the same battle lands we fought in last.</String>
		<String _locID="48081">We were allied forces in our last battle, but it was as though we laid asleep and cumbrous, and lost the day.</String>
		<String _locID="48082">Last time we fought as a team, but the trail was long and unsatisfying.</String>
		<String _locID="48083">Honor be to my ally! We came in triumph in our last contest, and shall walk again the same now.</String>
		<String _locID="48084">It was good to battle by your side before. Let's walk the same path to glory again.</String>
		<String _locID="48085">I have paid the price twas due, so my war chief may again swing aloft his club.</String>
		<String _locID="48086">I will not let fear overcome me. I have paid the price to return our war chief to us.</String>
		<String _locID="48087">Our war chief has been returned to us.</String>
		<String _locID="48088">He was once lost, our war chief, but my warriors have just rescued him.</String>
		<String _locID="48089">I have rescued our great war chief.</String>
		<String _locID="48090">Shout loud your war-cry! I have seen the enemy's town center and no army is there.</String>
		<String _locID="48091">Alert your forces. I have seen the enemy's town and it lies undefended.</String>
		<String _locID="48092">Our enemy's town center has no barracks near it.</String>
		<String _locID="48093">There is no barracks in the shadow of our enemy's town center.</String>
		<String _locID="48094">The enemy Town Center is under my gaze. I see no stable standing near it.</String>
		<String _locID="48095">The enemy is without a stable in his main town.</String>
		<String _locID="48096">Coin runs into your coffers, a tribute from my own.</String>
		<String _locID="48097">Spend this coin wisely, my ally.</String>
		<String _locID="48098">Your town has been given a gift of coin.</String>
		<String _locID="48099">Food I grant you - feed your forces.</String>
		<String _locID="48100">Food from our maize fields, green and shining.</String>
		<String _locID="48101">Wood has been sent. Wood for your houses of war.</String>
		<String _locID="48102">Here is wood from our homeland forests.</String>
		<String _locID="48103">We move to smite the enemy; break his skull, as ice is broken.</String>
		<String _locID="48104">The enemy has drawn me to him. I prepare to attack his base.</String>
		<String _locID="48105">We send raiders sneaking through the forest. Their gatherers shall be dragged down by our claws.</String>
		<String _locID="48106">The enemy gathers, and now I raid him.</String>
		<String _locID="48107">We will move now as the great bear of the mountain, the terror of the nations, to attack the enemy's main town.</String>
		<String _locID="48108">The enemy's main town is ripe for assault, like sugar from the maple.</String>
		<String _locID="48109">The enemy's allied Native village shall tremble as a reed, for we stomp to it with heavy step.</String>
		<String _locID="48110">This Native village belongs to the enemy. It stands between us and victory.</String>
		<String _locID="48111">We are strongest; we shall attack a trading site.</String>
		<String _locID="48112">I send word to you, ally. I prepare to attack this trade site.</String>
		<String _locID="48113">Standing fearlessly with you, my warriors will join in your siege of this enemy site.</String>
		<String _locID="48114">I will join you in this attack.</String>
		<String _locID="48115">Cease not your attack. As a biting wind I shall fly to fight by your side.</String>
		<String _locID="48116">This is where my military base shall be planted, and grow as a terrible thistle grows.</String>
		<String _locID="48117">I shall spread my power over this clearing, and build the buildings of war.</String>
		<String _locID="48118">This is my claim. The area I shall make my base.</String>
		<String _locID="48119">My town center shall rise and hold to this ground, as a root to the earth.</String>
		<String _locID="48120">This is my next town center location.</String>
		<String _locID="48121">The trees will witness it; a new town center will arise here.</String>
		<String _locID="48122">We shall raise our war clubs over a Native village, and claim it as our own.</String>
		<String _locID="48123">We lie low in ambush, to soon gain the help of these Native warriors.</String>
		<String _locID="48124">Our armies shall be strengthened with these Natives, as claws on the cougar.</String>
		<String _locID="48125">The winds of heaven blow over us, and we have decided to claim a trade site.</String>
		<String _locID="48126">We come with caw and clamor, and will capture a trade site.</String>
		<String _locID="48127">The fog lays on the river, but none upon our heart. We shall defend this building.</String>
		<String _locID="48128">This building is important to me. It will be guarded well.</String>
		<String _locID="48129">Not even a ghost that goes at sunrise shall halt us in our goal. We shall defend this place.</String>
		<String _locID="48130">We shall stop them here, with all our craft and cunning.</String>
		<String _locID="48131">We will defend this Native settlement to the end.</String>
		<String _locID="48132">Our foe may croak fiercely his displeasure, but we shall defend this Native settlement to the end.</String>
		<String _locID="48133">The forests and rivers around us shall know what we do this day -- this town shall remain defended.</String>
		<String _locID="48134">Our enemies will not struggle past us. We will hold this town</String>
		<String _locID="48135">Hear us, ally. We sing and shout this news. We defend this trade site.</String>
		<String _locID="48136">This trade site belongs to us now, and no foe shall take it under this sky.</String>
		<String _locID="48137">As the cormorant and curlew, returning always to their nests, we shall continue to send you coin.</String>
		<String _locID="48138">The coin will continue coming to you from our coffers.</String>
		<String _locID="48139">Food will continue to arrive to you, my ally, as the river flowing silent but strong.</String>
		<String _locID="48140">I will keep sending wood, the grass of giants.</String>
		<String _locID="48141">Wild and wailing, my warriors shall come to fight alongside you here.</String>
		<String _locID="48142">We run through the forests to help defend this site.</String>
		<String _locID="48143">Hold the line, my ally. We will join you in the defense of that site soon.</String>
		<String _locID="48144">Must I shout down the smoke flue, to remind you of my presence?</String>
		<String _locID="48145">One day we will be done with fighting. But that day is not today.</String>
		<String _locID="48146">Coin, I request of you.</String>
		<String _locID="48147">I greatly need you to give me some coin.</String>
		<String _locID="48148">Food, I request of you.</String>
		<String _locID="48149">Maize or meat, it matters not. I ask only for any food you can give me.</String>
		<String _locID="48150">Wood, I request of you.</String>
		<String _locID="48151">It is odd, but we of the forest need to request wood of you.</String>
		<String _locID="48152">Our breath comes sharply to our nostrils; we thank you for joining in our forward fight.</String>
		<String _locID="48153">A mysterious darkness awaited us, if you had not entered that battle and saved our heads.</String>
		<String _locID="48154">We needed your help as the tree needs sunlight and rain.</String>
		<String _locID="48155">Bless you for the gift of coin.</String>
		<String _locID="48156">Thank you for the golden gift.</String>
		<String _locID="48157">Bless you for your gift of food.</String>
		<String _locID="48158">The food you sent was better than we dared hope.</String>
		<String _locID="48159">Blessings upon you for helping to draw a circle of protection around our base.</String>
		<String _locID="48160">We thought the great death serpent was sliding close, but you came and saved us.</String>
		<String _locID="48161">Your warriors saved our town.</String>
		<String _locID="48162">Food from your fields, coin from your coffers, timber from your forests - thank you for these things.</String>
		<String _locID="48163">You are a valued ally. Thank you for the resources.</String>
		<String _locID="48164">Your gift of timber is good. Thank you.</String>
		<String _locID="48165">Wood is what we needed. Timber is power.</String>
		<String _locID="48166">What will protect us from destruction? The Aztec enemy is so mighty!</String>
		<String _locID="48167">I fear the serpent of death approaches. Our Aztec foe is very great.</String>
		<String _locID="48168">What will protect us from destruction? The British enemy is so mighty!</String>
		<String _locID="48169">The British are like magicians, creating armies from the very soil. We are losing.</String>
		<String _locID="48170">What will protect us from destruction? The Dutch enemy is so mighty!</String>
		<String _locID="48171">The Dutch have poisonous exhalations. We grow weaker before them.</String>
		<String _locID="48172">What will protect us from destruction? The French enemy is so mighty!</String>
		<String _locID="48173">The French move like a blazing serpent. We are losing the fight.</String>
		<String _locID="48174">What will protect us from destruction? The German enemy is so mighty!</String>
		<String _locID="48175">Do the Germans have fiery breath? Our armies are wiped out before them.</String>
		<String _locID="48176">What will protect us from destruction? The false Iroquois are so mighty!</String>
		<String _locID="48177">We are losing to the false Iroquois nation!</String>
		<String _locID="48178">What will protect us from destruction? The Ottoman enemy is so mighty!</String>
		<String _locID="48179">The Ottoman are defeating us. Their armies are so powerful.</String>
		<String _locID="48180">What will protect us from destruction? The Portuguese enemy is so mighty!</String>
		<String _locID="48181">I feel we are losing. The Portuguese have a mighty stature in battle.</String>
		<String _locID="48182">What will protect us from destruction? The Russian enemy is so mighty!</String>
		<String _locID="48183">The Russians are too powerful. We appear to be losing this fight.</String>
		<String _locID="48184">What will protect us from destruction? The Sioux enemy is so mighty!</String>
		<String _locID="48185">The Sioux enemy steps on us as if we were ants on the ground. I fear we are losing.</String>
		<String _locID="48186">What will protect us from destruction? The Spanish enemy is so mighty!</String>
		<String _locID="48187">The Spanish empire has great strength. I fear we may be crushed before their might.</String>
		<String _locID="48188">Our death song may have begun. But there is hope; the Aztec foe is wounded and weak.</String>
		<String _locID="48189">Our death song may have begun. But there is hope; the British foe is wounded and weak.</String>
		<String _locID="48190">Our death song may have begun. But there is hope; the Dutch foe is wounded and weak.</String>
		<String _locID="48191">Our death song may have begun. But there is hope; the French foe is wounded and weak.</String>
		<String _locID="48192">Our death song may have begun. But there is hope; the German foe is wounded and weak.</String>
		<String _locID="48193">Our death song may have begun. But there is hope; the Iroquois rebels are wounded and weak.</String>
		<String _locID="48194">Our death song may have begun. But there is hope; the Ottoman foe is wounded and weak.</String>
		<String _locID="48195">Our death song may have begun. But there is hope; the Portuguese foe is wounded and weak.</String>
		<String _locID="48196">Our death song may have begun. But there is hope; the Russian foe is wounded and weak.</String>
		<String _locID="48197">Our death song may have begun. But there is hope; the Sioux foe is wounded and weak.</String>
		<String _locID="48198">Our death song may have begun. But there is hope; the Spanish foe is wounded and weak.</String>
		<String _locID="48199">Heed these words, my ally. You are yet strong, but my own blood is now flowing swiftly from me.</String>
		<String _locID="48200">Far and wide among the nations will my fall be told, and I may yet drag you down with me.</String>
		<String _locID="48201">The rush of death's wings can be heard over the treetops. I fear it is searching for us both, my ally.</String>
		<String _locID="48202">The enemy is treading us down like blades of grass.</String>
		<String _locID="48203">We stand terrible and strong against our foes at this time.</String>
		<String _locID="48204">Our foes cannot hope to compete with our strength.</String>
		<String _locID="48205">We have the advantage in this war, and you are the stronger bear between us.</String>
		<String _locID="48206">The enemy is envious, we are winning and you have grown strongest of all in this war.</String>
		<String _locID="48207">Our war clubs are ruling the battlefields, with my own club raised highest of all.</String>
		<String _locID="48208">We are audacious, overbearing, heartless. We are winning and my army is strongest of all.</String>
		<String _locID="48209">I fear we may be fighting a battle in which courage but not hope remains.</String>
		<String _locID="48210">We are being driven back. Our cause may be lost.</String>
		<String _locID="48211">The claws of the enemy sink into us; soon we will be nothing but scarecrows ragged in the wind.</String>
		<String _locID="48212">By the spirits of the water, our foes conspire to murder us all.</String>
		<String _locID="48213">The skill and wiles of our enemy have taken us, ground us and destroyed us. We cannot win.</String>
		<String _locID="48214">There is no hope for us now. We fight on as a blade of grass against an oak tree.</String>
		<String _locID="48215">Our foe has claimed the buildings he needs to win. We must rise and answer him at once.</String>
		<String _locID="48216">The enemy has enough buildings to claim victory. We must conspire to prevent this.</String>
		<String _locID="48217">I have grim news; our enemy has claimed the first Native trading post site.</String>
		<String _locID="48218">How quickly our foe has moved to claim a Native ally.</String>
		<String _locID="48219">Our enemy plots mischief; they have claimed the first trading route site.</String>
		<String _locID="48220">Very smooth and quick he has acted; our foe has claimed the first trading site.</String>
		<String _locID="48221">This is good; you have taken the lead in claiming Native sites.</String>
		<String _locID="48222">We cannot wait motionless in the sleeping shadows, as our foe continue to claim buildings.</String>
		<String _locID="48223">The marauders have grasped the lead in trading sites.</String>
		<String _locID="48224">There is drowsiness in the air, but we must not sleep. The enemy has taken the lead on trade sites.</String>
		<String _locID="48225">You plot wisely. You have claimed a Native site before any other in the land.</String>
		<String _locID="48226">Your vision is clear. If we have Native allies, no one shall stand before us.</String>
		<String _locID="48227">You lead the flock, swooping to your claim of the trade site before any other.</String>
		<String _locID="48228">Our empire is expanding with your claiming of that trading site.</String>
		<String _locID="48229">You are swift; you have gathered a treasure before anyone else.</String>
		<String _locID="48230">In the battle for treasures, you have dealt the first blow.</String>
		<String _locID="48231">Every small thing adds to the greater whole of our eventual victory.</String>
		<String _locID="48232">You are gulping down treasures as a frog gulps flies.</String>
		<String _locID="48233">The coin you have discovered in that treasure gleams as an omen of our success.</String>
		<String _locID="48234">More coin means more strength, my ally.</String>
		<String _locID="48235">The treasure opens, and food for you has been found within it.</String>
		<String _locID="48236">I witness that you have discovered a fine treasure of food.</String>
		<String _locID="48237">I croak fiercely my displeasure; you are gathering treasures too swiftly for me to keep up.</String>
		<String _locID="48238">Do I have a drowsiness in my bones? I cannot gather treasures as fast as you.</String>
		<String _locID="48239">Careful, my ally. Treasures near my base are precious to me.</String>
		<String _locID="48240">That treasure was in the very shadow of my war encampment.</String>
		<String _locID="48241">That treasure has given you new warriors. Long may they fight.</String>
		<String _locID="48242">You have found a treasure of warriors, armed and waiting.</String>
		<String _locID="48243">A treasure has granted you villagers.</String>
		<String _locID="48244">Put those villagers to work on your lands.</String>
		<String _locID="48245">Wood from the tall trees, brought low for our use.</String>
		<String _locID="48246">Timber from that treasure will help our cause.</String>
		<String _locID="48247">We have the advantage in Native allies now, thanks to your efforts.</String>
		<String _locID="48248">You have claimed more Native allies than our foes.</String>
		<String _locID="48249">You have given us the lead in trading route sites.</String>
		<String _locID="48250">Your actions are as swift as the falcon. You have another trade site.</String>
		<String _locID="48251">Like the beaver's dams of trunks and branches, you seek to hold back the flood of our foe.</String>
		<String _locID="48252">Walls will defend you well, but your warrior's hearts are the greatest defense of all.</String>
		<String _locID="48253">I have claimed the first Native site.</String>
		<String _locID="48254">We have allied with more Native peoples of the lands.</String>
		<String _locID="48255">None have claimed a trade site but I.</String>
		<String _locID="48256">Like a meadowlark upon a grasshopper, I clutch this lonely treasure.</String>
		<String _locID="48257">Hear me roar like a wintry tempest as I claim another treasure.</String>
		<String _locID="48258">I have discovered a treasure, with a treasure within it.</String>
		<String _locID="48259">I am gathering only that which belongs to me.</String>
		<String _locID="48260">An opening in the forest has revealed a treasure, and within it a savory morsel.</String>
		<String _locID="48261">I have passed through your base and tidied the land of a discarded treasure.</String>
		<String _locID="48262">You did not want the treasure near your war encampment, did you?</String>
		<String _locID="48263">As if vanishing into the forest, you are far behind me in gathering treasures.</String>
		<String _locID="48264">Perhaps a morning will dawn in which you have gathered as many treasures as I.</String>
		<String _locID="48265">I have discovered a fine treasure; foot warriors who shall join my army.</String>
		<String _locID="48266">Another tribal warrior for me.</String>
		<String _locID="48267">This treasure has yielded a villager.</String>
		<String _locID="48268">A treasure has given me another villager to help expand my power.</String>
		<String _locID="48269">Wood has been found, and I am glad.</String>
		<String _locID="48270">Better than grass is wood.</String>
		<String _locID="48271">We have another Native site.</String>
		<String _locID="48272">Like the rushing wind, I have taken a trade site.</String>
		<String _locID="48273">Heed my words of wisdom; we need to continue claiming trading sites.</String>
		<String _locID="48274">I am building walls to protect us.</String>
		<String _locID="48275">I am constructing walls, the enemy shall not blow over us.</String>
		<String _locID="48276">We deserve a headdress of bright plumage, for we have claimed enough trading posts.</String>
		<String _locID="48277">We must prepare for a response, now that we hold the buildings we need to win.</String>
		<String _locID="48278">A clamor rises in my heart; I see that your rating is much lower than last time we met.</String>
		<String _locID="48279">Why has your rating dropped so low? Have you been stooping among the lilies instead of fighting?</String>
		<String _locID="48280">Your rating is much higher.</String>
		<String _locID="48281">You are a wonder. How did you raise your rating so high?</String>
		<String _locID="48282">I struggle to regain my balance, as I look upon how much more experience you have.</String>
		<String _locID="48283">I will whisper to the leaves and blossoms, the wonder of your great increase in experience.</String>
		<String _locID="48284">We are nearly dead among the shouting people. We have only a minute left to live.</String>
		<String _locID="48285">Do you not hear the warning? We are within one minute of the end!</String>
		<String _locID="48286">I hear the voices of triumph coming nearer. In one minute we will win.</String>
		<String _locID="48287">Hear my words of wisdom; we will soon win this war!</String>
		<String _locID="48288">So long and rough the way of battle, when several tribes have entered the fray at once.</String>
		<String _locID="48289">This battle shall be toil and trouble.</String>
		<String _locID="48290">You have struck me down.</String>
		<String _locID="48291">How did that occur? We were strong, bold, yet you still defeated our army.</String>
		<String _locID="48292">The war spirit promised us a victory. You made the war spirit a liar.</String>
		<String _locID="48293">I rent your army into shreds, just as we knew it would be.</String>
		<String _locID="48294">We have shown you the death dance.</String>
		<String _locID="48295">My armies fly higher than the moon, and cast your warriors beneath the soil!</String>
		<String _locID="48296">You are like a small canoe, to be dashed against my rocky headlands.</String>
		<String _locID="48297">Look upon these battlefields, my enemy; look at the pathway of your ghosts!</String>
		<String _locID="48298">Full in sight my ally has arrived. The waves of war splash now in my favor.</String>
		<String _locID="48299">Running straight across the heavens, my ally enters the fray just in time!</String>
		<String _locID="48300">The battle is slipping from my grasp like dust and leaves that swirl away.</String>
		<String _locID="48301">Your ally bought warriors, with plumes and war clubs. This battle is going foul.</String>
		<String _locID="48302">I gaze into a cavern dark and dreary; the news that you have advanced so soon ahead of me.</String>
		<String _locID="48303">Dash to advance, dash for the moon. Either way, your empire will crumble before mine.</String>
		<String _locID="48304">I see you have claimed a Native site, but I care not.</String>
		<String _locID="48305">How did you fool those Natives into following you?</String>
		<String _locID="48306">One of my Native sites has been struck a blow, with dark thunder I have lost it.</String>
		<String _locID="48307">You strike boldly, but that structure was but a trifle to me.</String>
		<String _locID="48308">My town center has tumbled to rocky ruin.</String>
		<String _locID="48309">The smoke from the town center you have crushed blots the sun.</String>
		<String _locID="48310">Your mischief is unwanted; my trade site has fallen by your hand.</String>
		<String _locID="48311">With the destruction of that trade site, you have caused my anger to burn.</String>
		<String _locID="48312">I submit that your time of wild adventure is over; will you ever advance from the Discovery Age?</String>
		<String _locID="48313">Hurry and advance, and join the fray.</String>
		<String _locID="48314">Where are your tricks and gambles now? Or are you too upset to advance in age?</String>
		<String _locID="48315">Are you so confident that you think you can defeat me from the lowly age you rest in now?</String>
		<String _locID="48316">The tempest of my wrath shall overtake you.</String>
		<String _locID="48317">What good is advancing an age, when your army's bones will soon be nourishing the grass?</String>
		<String _locID="48318">Welcome to the Industrial Age, oh chief of flying leaves and swirling dust.</String>
		<String _locID="48319">If your plan is to watch my empire advance beyond yours, it is working.</String>
		<String _locID="48320">A great windy waste separates your town center from your ally's. You will be lonely in death as well.</String>
		<String _locID="48321">Your location is far from your allies. It is good for quiet meditation, or your peaceful destruction under my war clubs.</String>
		<String _locID="48322">Your bases are huddled like robin chicks in a nest. We shall light your tree aflame.</String>
		<String _locID="48323">Your town is so close to your allies. Another mistake to learn from.</String>
		<String _locID="48324">One of your Native sites has been destroyed. You will not win the war that way.</String>
		<String _locID="48325">Your Native site has been destroyed, tossed in gusty tumult.</String>
		<String _locID="48326">The Natives you had joined with are done with you at last.</String>
		<String _locID="48327">I cast your people into confusion.</String>
		<String _locID="48328">You don't need that town center where you are going.</String>
		<String _locID="48329">Through your teeth you buzz and mutter, as I destroy your trading site.</String>
		<String _locID="48330">Did you sing a death song for your fallen trading site?</String>
		<String _locID="48331">I cast to you words of anger and resentment. There shall be no peace between us.</String>
		<String _locID="48332">All my warriors gather around me, and together we send you a greeting of doom.</String>
		<String _locID="48333">The challenge level in this contest has been increased. It will not affect the outcome.</String>
		<String _locID="48334">Last time we met we had a challenge, yet you wish to increase it even further?</String>
		<String _locID="48335">The difficulty level in our last battle left you trampled you like the grass.</String>
		<String _locID="48336">Your courage melts, as well it should before my armies.</String>
		<String _locID="48337">We have battled in these lands before. Regardless of the outcome then, this time my wrath shall overtake you.</String>
		<String _locID="48338">Although the odds may be more to your liking this time, the results will still leave you battered and bruised.</String>
		<String _locID="48339">We will pound you as maize is pounded.</String>
		<String _locID="48340">You beat my war chief almost to death, but I have rescued him.</String>
		<String _locID="48341">I see the movement of your patrol as if through streaming sunshine.</String>
		<String _locID="48342">I have glimpsed your army. My heart holds only pity for you.</String>
		<String _locID="48343">I see the army you have fielded, puffed with pride, but so soon to fall.</String>
		<String _locID="48344">Your children appear to be wandering lost in the wilderness. I will put them out of their misery for you.</String>
		<String _locID="48345">The troops you have sent near my town will be beaten if they come nearer.</String>
		<String _locID="48346">Your army near my town shall sing the song of fear, when they encounter my own.</String>
		<String _locID="48347">Your attack on my villagers is craven, o cowardly foe.</String>
		<String _locID="48348">My villagers have no interest in dying. Cease.</String>
		<String _locID="48349">I will crush the skulls of your warriors, and you shall bear them home on travois made from branches.</String>
		<String _locID="48350">Your large army has wandered aimlessly into my lands. Retrieve it.</String>
		<String _locID="48351">Your warriors are wandering far from their homes. Best to retrieve them before they are cut down as grass.</String>
		<String _locID="48352">Your army looks wild and wayward. I will help it find its way.</String>
		<String _locID="48353">Your army's shadow has darkened the gateways of my base.</String>
		<String _locID="48354">What is this army doing in my war encampment?</String>
		<String _locID="48355">Your small army is like flotsam in a soiled river</String>
		<String _locID="48356">Teach your soldiers to walk where they are wanted, far from my lands.</String>
		<String _locID="48357">Your town center is like a duck awaiting my arrow.</String>
		<String _locID="48358">So you are found. Next comes the song of destruction.</String>
		<String _locID="48359">A small mishap has befallen you; I have won in our struggle for this treasure.</String>
		<String _locID="48360">Both of us reached for that treasure, but your fingers returned to you with nothing.</String>
		<String _locID="48361">My army has arrived to crush you like pond reeds.</String>
		<String _locID="48362">My warriors are here, just in time to wring the life from you.</String>
		<String _locID="48363">It is too quiet. I yearn to hear shouting from the forest; a whir and beat of pinions, anything.</String>
		<String _locID="48364">This silence is like ice on a lake, waiting for a fishing hole.</String>
		<String _locID="48365">Have you lost all hope? Your silence should not surprise me.</String>
		<String _locID="48366">Too swift of foot and strong of tomahawk are your warriors. I admit defeat.</String>
		<String _locID="48367">This war is nearly done. I am ready to fight no more forever.</String>
		<String _locID="48368">You have made it impossible for us to win that way.</String>
		<String _locID="48369">Like a swift arrow, you have taken the lead on claiming sites.</String>
		<String _locID="48370">You may have taken the lead here, but the race is not yet decided.</String>
		<String _locID="48371">It matters not at all that you have gathered the first treasure in this land. I shall gather the true prize; victory.</String>
		<String _locID="48372">While you are rushing for treasures, my warriors are learning to fire two arrows to your one.</String>
		<String _locID="48373">Enjoy squirreling away your treasures. They will be well enjoyed by my invading warriors.</String>
		<String _locID="48374">You are dressed for travel and armed for hunting, and the best you can come up with is a few coins?</String>
		<String _locID="48375">The mound of food is the biggest triumph you are likely to enjoy today.</String>
		<String _locID="48376">Enjoy the food from that treasure. You may have found your last meal.</String>
		<String _locID="48377">What good will your treasures do you if your head is rolling on the grass?</String>
		<String _locID="48378">You dared to steal a treasure close to my base. We dare to place a living coal where your heart is.</String>
		<String _locID="48379">The treasures around my base are yours if you can get them. However, the land under your base is mine.</String>
		<String _locID="48380">You have discovered some warriors to help you. A grim day for them.</String>
		<String _locID="48381">I wonder: will that warrior flee from battle with the rest of your army?</String>
		<String _locID="48382">You have crossed the rushing rivers, climbed the ancient mountains, only to gain a villager?</String>
		<String _locID="48383">The sticks of wood you have gained from that treasure will surely bring glory and fame to your empire.</String>
		<String _locID="48384">I see the walls you are lifting up around your base. Like bits of ice, before my summer sun.</String>
		<String _locID="48385">A wall may stop the breeze, but it cannot stop the tempest that is my wrath.</String>
		<String _locID="48386">My dominion of the land and all of its inhabitants has begun.</String>
		<String _locID="48387">Under my wise leadership, I am the first to bring the people of the land together.</String>
		<String _locID="48388">I am like Ishkoodah, the comet. I have claimed a trade site before anyone else.</String>
		<String _locID="48389">The path of the trading route runs through my empire, now.</String>
		<String _locID="48390">I have gathered another treasure, and it has filled me with joy.</String>
		<String _locID="48391">The treasures of the wilderness are mine for the taking.</String>
		<String _locID="48392">Gaze upon my skills. Another treasure is mine.</String>
		<String _locID="48393">I have gained coin from a treasure.</String>
		<String _locID="48394">This food will help build the strength of my warriors. From the way yours fight, you must be feeding them bark.</String>
		<String _locID="48395">There was a treasure near your base, but it is there no longer.</String>
		<String _locID="48396">Treasures are flowing into my coffers like drifting snow in a blizzard. It must be summer in your tiny kingdom.</String>
		<String _locID="48397">One more warrior to bring cheerful harm to your empire.</String>
		<String _locID="48398">The villager I have discovered will take me one step closer to cleansing this land of you.</String>
		<String _locID="48399">We will send the wood we just discovered right over. As arrows.</String>
		<String _locID="48400">If you think you have cast fear into our hearts because you have claimed a Native site, you reason like a cattail.</String>
		<String _locID="48401">While you were stretching your hand to pluck that trade site, my warriors were training to sever the arm it is connected to.</String>
		<String _locID="48402">The clock has begun to count. We shall chop off its hands.</String>
		<String _locID="48403">We have begun the clock. You have nothing left but to despair.</String>
		<String _locID="48404">Your rating is lower than a groundhog's basement.</String>
		<String _locID="48405">How did you raise your rating to the clouds? No matter, I will bring it back to where it belongs.</String>
		<String _locID="48406">You have improved, but it is still as though you hope to walk to the moon.</String>
		<String _locID="48407">Your experience has increased. Surely your abilities have not kept match.</String>
		<String _locID="48408">Hands unseen begin to shake. In moments all shall be taken from us.</String>

		<String _locID="48553">I admit newfound respect for the mighty Aztec empire. They are kicking our hindquarters.</String>
		<String _locID="48554">We cannot stand before the Iroquois. They are too powerful for us to fight.</String>
		<String _locID="48555">The Sioux are truly a mighty empire.</String>

		<String _locID="48559">The Aztecs are weak and can be defeated if we attack them together, but even then I'm afraid we will lose this war.</String>
		<String _locID="48560">Together we can destroy the Iroquois, but I'm afraid the war as a whole is not ours to win.</String>
		<String _locID="48561">Why don't we just team up against the Sioux? It is clear we will not be winning this war anyway.</String>
		<String _locID="48562">If we cannot attack their trading posts now, perhaps it is time we consider getting our house in order.</String>
		<String _locID="48563">We are sixty seconds from losing. Shall we surrender now and spare ourselves the ignominy, or shall we make one last push to overthrow the enemy's trade monopoly?</String>

		<String _locID="48576">Take that! And expect it again, just as good!</String>
		<String _locID="48577">There. Now, we can have a stand up fight. I will not tolerate any more of your tricks.</String>
		<String _locID="48578">The enemy has a trade monopoly! We have to act fast!</String>
		<String _locID="48579">Oh no. We'll need to get our act together, and quickly!</String>
		<String _locID="48580">Look sharp now, we have work to do. Let us be about it!</String>
		<String _locID="48581">How sweet - a trade monopoly!</String>
		<String _locID="48582">Now all we have to do is sit back and wait for victory to fall into our laps.</String>
		<String _locID="48583">Time brings victory to the patient. Would you join me for tea?</String>
		<String _locID="48584">The fight is not over yet. Your timer does not mean we are finished.</String>
		<String _locID="48585">Oh dear, now I suppose I shall have to send my armies to annihilate you. And we were having such fun.</String>
		<String _locID="48586">My lobsterbacks know just how to deal with your trading posts!</String>
		<String _locID="48587">Hear that? The clock is ticking now. Just a few short minutes and you lose!</String>
		<String _locID="48588">Oh dear, what is that I hear? Why it's... it's your defeat approaching. Tick tick tick.</String>
		<String _locID="48589">Look at the timer. Tick, tick, tick. The countdown to doom.</String>
		<String _locID="48590">The Aztecs do build lovely cities. Too bad they will soon lie in ruin.</String>
		<String _locID="48591">A gallant fight from the Iroquois. I am almost sad to see them defeated. Almost.</String>
		<String _locID="48592">The Sioux will soon be defeated. More's the pity.</String>
		<String _locID="48593">The Aztecs are arrayed in their finest regalia, a fearsome sight indeed.</String>
		<String _locID="48594">The Iroquois are strong and growing stronger.</String>
		<String _locID="48595">Though we may not understand their ways, we should not underestimate the Sioux.</String>
		<String _locID="48596">I had never thought to see any stand against our alliance. Alas! The Aztecs not only stand, they tower!</String>
		<String _locID="48597">The Iroquois cannot be stopped, I fear.</String>
		<String _locID="48598">I'm afraid the Sioux are going to be our undoing.</String>
		<String _locID="48599">The Aztecs are close to defeat! Let us make one last grand rally and take them with us!</String>
		<String _locID="48600">The Iroquois cling to a thin thread. Perhaps we can cut it before we are defeated.</String>
		<String _locID="48601">With our last breath let us take battle to the flagging Sioux!</String>
		<String _locID="48602">If we cannot attack their trading posts now, then it is indeed over.</String>
		<String _locID="48603">I told you that trust in me was well-placed. We are close to victory.</String>
		<String _locID="48604">We have persevered this time, my friend. Ottoman goods and diplomacy have won again!</String>
		<String _locID="48605">There is still time for me to snatch victory from the lion's mouth.</String>
		<String _locID="48606">No matter where you go, your destiny follows you. Yours has followed you to the brink of defeat.</String>
		<String _locID="48607">He bites his tongue who speaks in haste. Do not crow your victory from the hilltops yet.</String>
		<String _locID="48608">I have persevered, and soon I shall be rewarded.</String>
		<String _locID="48609">If skill could be gained by watching, then dogs would be butchers. And you would be a general.</String>
		<String _locID="48610">One already wet does not feel the rain. You, my friend, are soaked in failure!</String>
		<String _locID="48611">They have destroyed one of our trading posts and stolen away our well-deserved victory.</String>
		<String _locID="48612">We were so close to victory, my friend. Perhaps we should try again.</String>
		<String _locID="48613">Thorns and roses grow from the same root. The rose you have found will soon show you its thorns.</String>
		<String _locID="48614">That is quite enough of that!</String>
		<String _locID="48615">An open door invites enemies. Forgive me for walking through yours and crushing you.</String>
		<String _locID="48616">Your children's grandchildren will not look back on this defeat with shame. No, not at all.</String>
		<String _locID="48617">We should have known they would try to win this way.</String>
		<String _locID="48618">Victory does not come so easily as starting a timer. Who buys cheap buys dear.</String>
		<String _locID="48619">They have chosen to be the nail rather than the hammer. Poor choice.</String>
		<String _locID="48620">A red apple invites stones. Our prosperity will make us a target. We must prepare.</String>
		<String _locID="48621">We have chosen to be the anvil rather than the hammer. Our patience will outlast your strength.</String>
		<String _locID="48622">Patience is bitter, but it bears sweet fruit. Now the waiting begins.</String>
		<String _locID="48623">My armies will crush the victory you seek. But where will they strike?</String>
		<String _locID="48624">There are many places you must defend. But where will Suleiman attack?</String>
		<String _locID="48625">You cannot hold two watermelons under one arm. How do you expect to keep all those trading posts?</String>
		<String _locID="48626">My victory is inevitable. Surrender and I will treat you and your soldiers to a feast in my colony.</String>
		<String _locID="48627">The moment of my victory approaches. I can hear the bombards sounding.</String>
		<String _locID="48628">I am sure your children's children will be able to forgive your coming defeat.</String>
		<String _locID="48629">The Aztecs rival the Ottoman Empire in grandeur, though not for much longer.</String>
		<String _locID="48630">The Iroquois alliances are shattered and their time at an end.</String>
		<String _locID="48631">Fierce though they were, the Sioux are nearly finished.</String>
		<String _locID="48632">I can see smoke rising from the Aztec temples, but I do not believe the cities are burning. This makes me uneasy.</String>
		<String _locID="48633">The Iroquois are like lions - we had best keep a close eye on them.</String>
		<String _locID="48634">I hear hoofbeats in the distance - the Sioux are not idle. We must be wary.</String>
		<String _locID="48635">The Aztecs drain our strength like spilled blood.</String>
		<String _locID="48636">The Iroquois have proven stronger than our alliance.</String>
		<String _locID="48637">My ally, our mistakes catch up with us like the swift hoofbeats of Sioux warriors.</String>
		<String _locID="48638">We can discuss our many missteps later, with wine, over a proper meal, but now before we lose, let us attack the Aztecs one last time.</String>
		<String _locID="48639">We are in poor shape, but so are the Iroquois. Come, my ally, let us march on them one last time.</String>
		<String _locID="48640">The Sioux are weak, but we should be able to defeat them. There is no shame in small victories.</String>
		<String _locID="48641">Only one minute! Inconceivable! Attack, attack, attack, for we are at the critical moment!</String>
		<String _locID="48642">Ha! We have them now. One minute left before our enemy's total humiliation!</String>
		<String _locID="48643">Just one short minute and the game ends. Our foe is doomed and all because of my... er... I mean "our" power.</String>
		<String _locID="48644">I have not lost yet!</String>
		<String _locID="48645">Bah! I still have time to snatch victory from your unworthy hands!</String>
		<String _locID="48646">Coward! Come face me on battlefield!</String>
		<String _locID="48647">It is all over but the victory parade now. Ha!</String>
		<String _locID="48648">I tire of you. Now we will be finished.</String>
		<String _locID="48649">The end is near, cur. Grovel before me and I might show mercy. (laughter) Who am I kidding?</String>
		<String _locID="48650">Those knaves! Let us seek immediate retribution upon their bodies. They will pay for their insolence!</String>
		<String _locID="48651">Too bad. Now I will have to crush you the old-fashioned way.</String>
		<String _locID="48652">Ha! I knew you would not be able to pull it off! Now REAL fight begins.</String>
		<String _locID="48653">I have crushed your monopoly and now you are mine.</String>
		<String _locID="48654">Any last wishes before my army destroys your pathetic colony?</String>
		<String _locID="48655">Curse their eyes! The enemy has monopoly. They cannot win with strength, so they are trying with cunning.</String>
		<String _locID="48656">Quickly! We must destroy one of the enemy posts or all is lost!</String>
		<String _locID="48657">The cowards. They are not worthy of sniffing my boot.</String>
		<String _locID="48658">Building trading posts is not the most glorious way to win war, but is certainly effective.</String>
		<String _locID="48659">They have to come to us now to keep us from winning. Let us prepare an ambush.</String>
		<String _locID="48660">Good, I tire of these curs. Let us be done with them by any means possible.</String>
		<String _locID="48661">You would settle for winning that way? I am almost ashamed to be fighting you.</String>
		<String _locID="48662">Ha! You cannot believe your trading posts will survive the Russian army!</String>
		<String _locID="48663">So... you do not think you can beat me on battlefield. You are right, coward!</String>
		<String _locID="48664">Ha! The final nails in your coffin are being hammered right now.</String>
		<String _locID="48665">If - and is big if - you have trustworthy heirs, now would be the time to send them away.</String>
		<String _locID="48666">The shadow of mighty Russian empire has fallen on your pathetic colony.</String>
		<String _locID="48667">The Aztecs are ground to dust beneath my bootheel.</String>
		<String _locID="48668">The Iroquois are ended.</String>
		<String _locID="48669">Who can stand before us? Not the Sioux!</String>
		<String _locID="48670">The Aztecs are threat to our victory. We must attack!</String>
		<String _locID="48671">We should attack the Iroquois before they grow too strong.</String>
		<String _locID="48672">We have let the Sioux grow too strong. We must crush them before is too late.</String>
		<String _locID="48673">The outlook is grim. The Aztecs cause even bold Cossacks to tremble in saddle.</String>
		<String _locID="48674">How did you let this happen? The Iroquois cannot be left to grow so strong.</String>
		<String _locID="48675">How can my soldiers face the strange tactics of the Sioux? Tell me! Bah... I see you do not know either.</String>
		<String _locID="48676">I can see the end coming for us, but the Aztecs are weak - let us deal them one last blow.</String>
		<String _locID="48677">Though is clear we will not win, my scouts report that the Iroquois are vulnerable. One good attack might do them in.</String>
		<String _locID="48678">Quickly, we are losing, but the Sioux are compromised. We can take them down with us!</String>
		<String _locID="48679">Where are you? We must go faster.</String>
		<String _locID="48680">Do not stop. We are almost there.</String>
		<String _locID="48681">The time is short, but do not get too excited.</String>
		<String _locID="48682">You are close, but you are not there yet.</String>
		<String _locID="48683">Gloat now, dog - your time in the new world will not be long.</String>
		<String _locID="48684">Don't worry about the clock. It will be over soon enough.</String>
		<String _locID="48685">Look at the time. You do not have long to wait.</String>
		<String _locID="48686">Kneel before Isabella.</String>
		<String _locID="48687">What happened to you? Now we must start again.</String>
		<String _locID="48688">How dare you?</String>
		<String _locID="48689">How does it feel to be on the receiving end?</String>
		<String _locID="48690">That is what you get for challenging the Spanish.</String>
		<String _locID="48691">A bold attempt, but you see my power.</String>
		<String _locID="48692">The enemy has a trade monopoly. Wake up your men and put them to work.</String>
		<String _locID="48693">They have a trade monopoly. Take down a trading post or you'll taste my lash.</String>
		<String _locID="48694">The dogs have created a monopoly. We must take it down quickly.</String>
		<String _locID="48695">The timer has started. We must stay alert.</String>
		<String _locID="48696">We have a trade monopoly, pet. Can I trust you to watch my back?</String>
		<String _locID="48697">Be wary, pet. The timer has started and our enemies are everywhere.</String>
		<String _locID="48698">Ah, so the snake rears its ugly head.</String>
		<String _locID="48699">You think a trade monopoly will save you from the might of the Spanish?</String>
		<String _locID="48700">A trade monopoly? Do you think I will take this lying down?</String>
		<String _locID="48701">Now you see the cunning of the Spanish.</String>
		<String _locID="48702">Lie back, dog. It will all be over soon.</String>
		<String _locID="48703">How do you like that? It would seem your strategy has failed you.</String>
		<String _locID="48704">These Aztecs are strong, but not strong enough.</String>
		<String _locID="48705">It is time we drove these Iroquois back to their homelands.</String>
		<String _locID="48706">The Sioux are on the run. All that remains is to wipe out the survivors.</String>
		<String _locID="48707">These Aztecs fight with the strength of many.</String>
		<String _locID="48708">The Iroquois have more fight than I expected.</String>
		<String _locID="48709">Where do the Sioux get such strength?</String>
		<String _locID="48710">These Aztecs are too powerful. We are losing quickly.</String>
		<String _locID="48711">The Iroquois are too strong. I fear we may lose.</String>
		<String _locID="48712">Where are you pet? These Sioux are overpowering me.</String>
		<String _locID="48713">We must not lose to these weaklings. Pull yourself together.</String>
		<String _locID="48714">How can these Indians be winning? We need to do better.</String>
		<String _locID="48715">These Sioux are not as strong as they appear. We need to try harder, pet.</String>
		<String _locID="48716">Well my little upstart, I can't buy our way out of this one.</String>
		<String _locID="48717">Well, my little upstart, stick with me and do as I do. Successes like these will become old hat.</String>
		<String _locID="48718">You might defeat me this time but understand it won't be easy to do again.</String>
		<String _locID="48719">Do not be so certain of your victory that you grow lax in these last moments.</String>
		<String _locID="48720">Only one minute until the end. Can you feel the pressure?</String>
		<String _locID="48721">If you simply resign you can save yourself the disgrace of waiting out my victory.</String>
		<String _locID="48722">A minor setback; we will still be victorious in the end.</String>
		<String _locID="48723">Your actions have only delayed the inevitable.</String>
		<String _locID="48724">Did you think I would allow you to win in such a manner?</String>
		<String _locID="48725">Your countdown has stopped. What other tricks do you have up your sleeve?</String>
		<String _locID="48726">We've missed our chance at victory. Let us resign and fight again.</String>
		<String _locID="48727">We have some difficult fighting ahead of us, my little upstart. We must be quick about it.</String>
		<String _locID="48728">A trade monopoly at last! We will soon put an end to this war.</String>
		<String _locID="48729">The Dutch are known for both diplomacy and trade. This will be a fitting victory.</String>
		<String _locID="48730">Trying to take the easy way out, eh, my little upstart? I'll put an end to this nonsense.</String>
		<String _locID="48731">A victory by diplomacy and trade? I certainly didn't expect anything so civilized from you.</String>
		<String _locID="48732">Accept your defeat and just allow this timer to run out in peace.</String>
		<String _locID="48733">There. I have dictated the time of your defeat, unless you are made of sterner stuff than I have yet seen.</String>
		<String _locID="48734">What do you make of the Aztecs now that their great cities are reduced to smoking rubble?</String>
		<String _locID="48735">Our victory over the Iroquois is imminent.</String>
		<String _locID="48736">The Sioux fought fiercely, but our victory over them is close at hand.</String>
		<String _locID="48737">I am concerned about the Aztecs... they've grown strong while we were not looking.</String>
		<String _locID="48738">The Iroquois are all that I have heard and more. They are a dangerous enemy, not to be taken lightly.</String>
		<String _locID="48739">What I do not understand about the Sioux would fill volumes, but I know this - they are dangerous!</String>
		<String _locID="48740">Feathers and pelts, clubs and arrows - everywhere we turn we see... the Aztecs!</String>
		<String _locID="48741">It was a grave strategic mistake to let the Iroquois grow so strong. And now we are paying for it.</String>
		<String _locID="48742">The Sioux have met our every attack and come out stronger. It is over for us, my little upstart.</String>
		<String _locID="48743">The Aztecs are so weak - how is it that we are losing? Never mind; let us rally and deal them a deadly blow.</String>
		<String _locID="48744">With the Iroquois so weak we may be able to make one last attack before the war is lost.</String>
		<String _locID="48745">The Sioux are weak! I believe we have enough fight left in us to attack them once more.</String>
		<String _locID="48746">There is no time to waste! Throw everything you have at the enemy trading posts or we are done for!</String>
		<String _locID="48747">Just one... wait! Surely you don't want it to end this way? Demolish one of your trading posts, quickly! Let us end this with a bang, not a whimper.</String>
		<String _locID="48748">Victory is all but assured now. They have but one minute to stop us, and I do not think they can do it.</String>
		<String _locID="48749">This is quite irksome. I guess we will have to seek victory the old-fashioned way.</String>
		<String _locID="48750">You fools. You thought you could defeat me. I am now only seconds from winning.</String>
		<String _locID="48751">Well, I have stopped their victory countdown. No doubt they will resort to other means.</String>
		<String _locID="48752">Do not think this ends the threat to you.</String>
		<String _locID="48753">The problem: too many enemy trading posts. The solution: elimination. Problem solved.</String>
		<String _locID="48754">Keep calm. All we must do is knock down some of the enemy posts and all will be well.</String>
		<String _locID="48755">The trade monopoly timer has been started. Perhaps you can help protect what is rightfully ours.</String>
		<String _locID="48756">Do not relax your vigilance. The enemy will be desperate now.</String>
		<String _locID="48757">Clever of you to use map control and a trade monopoly to try for a victory. However, it will not work.</String>
		<String _locID="48758">Now the burden for action is on your shoulders. All I have to do is keep a firm grip on my trading posts and it's all over.</String>
		<String _locID="48759">The Aztec must not be feeling well to have fought so poorly.</String>
		<String _locID="48760">The Iroquois did not have the technology to oppose us.</String>
		<String _locID="48761">A little more pressure on the Sioux and they will surely concede this campaign.</String>
		<String _locID="48762">We have traveled too far to allow the Aztecs to become so powerful.</String>
		<String _locID="48763">The Iroquois look formidable; we should concentrate an attack on them.</String>
		<String _locID="48764">I am not sure what all their dancing is about, but it seems to make the Sioux strong.</String>
		<String _locID="48765">We should have found a way to ally with the Aztecs.</String>
		<String _locID="48766">This is first time I have seen the Iroquois so dangerous.</String>
		<String _locID="48767">How can we be losing to the Sioux?</String>
		<String _locID="48768">If we can take out the remaining Aztec army there will be one less foe to worry about.</String>
		<String _locID="48769">Before we are overrun, let us take out the puny Iroquois.</String>
		<String _locID="48770">The Sioux are weak; maybe we should have finished them off.</String>
		<String _locID="48771">We must make a move soon; our enemy is about to win.</String>
		<String _locID="48772">If we just hold on, there is little hope for our foe.</String>
		<String _locID="48773">It has been a pleasure battling you. I am saddened that you will win in this ignoble manner.</String>
		<String _locID="48774">I admit defeat, but I do not admit your winning in this manner was noble. A true commander would have flattened my empire.</String>
		<String _locID="48775">I predict another great victory for my empire, as a result of my achieving this monopoly.</String>
		<String _locID="48776">My brilliance has prevailed. Instead of crushing your town, I found another way to win.</String>
		<String _locID="48777">This is outrageous. How could my trade monopoly have been lost?!</String>
		<String _locID="48778">My trade monopoly has been lost.</String>
		<String _locID="48779">Your precious trade monopoly has been taken from you.</String>
		<String _locID="48780">Your trade monopoly has been defeated. You'll have to fight like a soldier now.</String>
		<String _locID="48781">Your attempt to claim this trade monopoly frightens me no more than the neighing of a horse.</String>
		<String _locID="48782">I perceive you hope to win with a trade monopoly. But of course, you will fail.</String>
		<String _locID="48783">It is a great and noble pleasure to discover that you have just claimed a trade monopoly!</String>
		<String _locID="48784">Excellent news, my ally. Our path to victory with a trade monopoly has begun.</String>
		<String _locID="48785">You will be forced to defend multiple locations, now that you have claimed a trade monopoly. But, he who defends everything defends nothing.</String>
		<String _locID="48786">Do you think this trade monopoly you have begun can lead you to victory? My army has other ideas.</String>
		<String _locID="48787">Truth is always the strongest argument. And the truth here is that I have just claimed a trade monopoly.</String>
		<String _locID="48788">The trade monopoly timer has begun. It will not be long until yet another victory belongs to us.</String>
		<String _locID="48789">Our Aztec foes must submit to a painful truth - they are almost defeated.</String>
		<String _locID="48790">Our Sioux enemy is nearly defeated.</String>
		<String _locID="48791">I see that our Iroquois foes are close to finished.</String>
		<String _locID="48792">Our Aztec enemies are much more powerful than our European sensibilities had guessed they would be.</String>
		<String _locID="48793">How is it that the Sioux are so powerful?</String>
		<String _locID="48794">We have found a mighty adversary in the Iroquois.</String>
		<String _locID="48795">Our mighty armies are being routed. It is the ferocity of the Aztecs that is taking us apart.</String>
		<String _locID="48796">We are humbled on two accounts. First, we are losing. Second, the Sioux are mightier than are we.</String>
		<String _locID="48797">How could these Iroquois be so powerful? Our team is losing badly.</String>
		<String _locID="48798">The grim truth is that our alliance is failing. Let us take the Aztecs down with us before we fall.</String>
		<String _locID="48799">We are losing this war, but we can still take the Sioux with us.</String>
		<String _locID="48800">Our team will be defeated soon, but we can destroy the Iroquois before we go.</String>

		<String _locID="66621" soundfilename="YTOKU0004">This battle is won. Now let us discuss how you can repay Tokugawa for his allegiance.</String>
		<String _locID="66622" soundfilename="YTOKU0005">You must invest in the machinery of war. Bring siege weapons to the gates of our enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="66623" soundfilename="YTOKU0006">Siege forces would help you sow seeds of  destruction.</String>
		<String _locID="66624" soundfilename="YTOKY0007">Take my advice. The pounding of hooves would lift your spirits in battle.</String>
		<String _locID="66625" soundfilename="YTOKU0008">We do not breed horses for their grace and posture, we breed them to trample our enemies.</String>
		<String _locID="66626" soundfilename="YTOKU0009">You are playing games.Train more foot soldiers, overwhelm the enemy and cease this spectacle.</String>
		<String _locID="66627" soundfilename="YTOKU0010">Train more foot soldiers and hurl them at the enemy. They mean nothing.</String>
		<String _locID="66628" soundfilename="YTOKU0011">Mistakes like this are why you need Tokugawa. Your men march right into their graves.</String>
		<String _locID="66629" soundfilename="YTOKU0012">With this attack, you show weakness and stupidity. Remove your men, or they will meet their deaths.</String>
		<String _locID="66630" soundfilename="YTOKU0013">The heavens cloud with arrows and smoke. This day of battle will never be forgotten.</String>
		<String _locID="66631" soundfilename="YTOKU0014">The future of Japan will be decided in this bloody mud. Stand your ground and fight!</String>
		<String _locID="66632" soundfilename="YTOKU0015">I foresaw this victory, as I do all of them. Tokugawa does not know the meaning of defeat.</String>
		<String _locID="66633" soundfilename="YTOKU0016">If Tokugawa marches, Tokugawa finds victory.</String>
		<String _locID="66634" soundfilename="YTOKU0017">Tokugawa has lived to see another day. So is the law of survival.</String>
		<String _locID="66635" soundfilename="YTOKU0018">The outcome was never in doubt. Tokugawa's vision always becomes the reality.</String>
		<String _locID="66636" soundfilename="YTOKU0019">You seem confused at our victory. Did you not realize you had sided with Tokugawa?</String>
		<String _locID="66637" soundfilename="YTOKU0020">Consider this victory further evidence of Tokugawa's superiority.</String>
		<String _locID="66638" soundfilename="YTOKU0021">You may follow Tokugawa on the road to victory. But remember your place.</String>
		<String _locID="66639" soundfilename="YTOKU0022">This battle should be easily won. So do not let your actions prove disastrous.</String>
		<String _locID="66640" soundfilename="YTOKU0023">Have you ever slaughtered a pen of squawking chickens? The coming battle will be very similar.</String>
		<String _locID="66641" soundfilename="YTOKU0024">Are you willing to make sacrifices to achieve victory? If not, it is you who will be the sacrifice.</String>
		<String _locID="66642" soundfilename="YTOKU0025">So, you are good for something after all. Tokugawa never would have guessed.</String>
		<String _locID="66643" soundfilename="YTOKU0026">Your warriors are useful as a distraction. Do not let them get in my way.</String>
		<String _locID="66644" soundfilename="YTOKU0027">The enemy has friends. It is strange they do not side with Tokugawa.</String>
		<String _locID="66645" soundfilename="YTOKU0028">This fight has leapt from Tokugawa's grasp. Other forces are at play.</String>
		<String _locID="66646" soundfilename="YTOKU0029">If Tokugawa must.</String>
		<String _locID="66647" soundfilename="YTOKU0030">Yes, but only because it is in Tokugawa's best interest.</String>
		<String _locID="66648" soundfilename="YTOKU0031">It is unnecessary, but Tokugawa will do it.</String>
		<String _locID="66649" soundfilename="YTOKU0032">Tokugawa thought of this long ago.</String>
		<String _locID="66650" soundfilename="YTOKU0033">Tokugawa shall spare some of his finest artillery.</String>
		<String _locID="66651" soundfilename="YTOKU0034">This artillery is Tokugawa's finest. Use it wisely.</String>
		<String _locID="66652" soundfilename="YTOKU0035">Tokugawa's riders are so unrivaled, even one of your limited skills could not make them fail.</String>
		<String _locID="66653" soundfilename="YTOKU0036">You will have riders if you so desire them.</String>
		<String _locID="66654" soundfilename="YTOKU0037">Listen for hoof beats. Tokugawa has sent horses to you...against his better judgement.</String>
		<String _locID="66655" soundfilename="YTOKU0038">Men are like blades of grass. Where one falls, another takes its place. You shall have your warriors.</String>
		<String _locID="66656" soundfilename="YTOKU0039">If more warriors will lead you to victory, then so be it.</String>
		<String _locID="66657" soundfilename="YTOKU0040">Yes. Perhaps your men will finally learn to fight from Tokugawa's warriors.</String>
		<String _locID="66658" soundfilename="YTOKU0041">Let me offer this advice. Greedy hands often lose their fingers.</String>
		<String _locID="66659" soundfilename="YTOKU0042">No. Tokugawa needs every log and every nugget.</String>
		<String _locID="66660" soundfilename="YTOKU0043">Why do you think a treasure is guarded? Waste your own resources.</String>
		<String _locID="66661" soundfilename="YTOKU0044">No. You are on your own.</String>
		<String _locID="66662" soundfilename="YTOKU0045">I am sorry, but our allegiance only goes so far.</String>
		<String _locID="66663" soundfilename="YTOKU0046">No, I do not think so.</String>
		<String _locID="66664" soundfilename="YTOKU0047">Tokugawa will not be party to your mistakes.</String>
		<String _locID="66665" soundfilename="YTOKU0048">Can you not build your own army? Tokugawa has no men to spare.</String>
		<String _locID="66666" soundfilename="YTOKU0049">My warriors fight for one lord only: Tokugawa.</String>
		<String _locID="66667" soundfilename="YTOKU0050">If you wish to fight a war, you must train your own warriors.</String>
		<String _locID="66668" soundfilename="YTOKU0051">You ask the impossible.</String>
		<String _locID="66669" soundfilename="YTOKU0052">A great leader must forge his own destiny. Tokugawa cannot help you.</String>
		<String _locID="66670" soundfilename="YTOKU0053">Only a fool would make such a request.</String>
		<String _locID="66671" soundfilename="YTOKU0054">Tokugawa's men will not be sacrificed so carelessly.</String>
		<String _locID="66672" soundfilename="YTOKU0055">Our forces are too few. Your weakness, as always, is your problem.</String>
		<String _locID="66673" soundfilename="YTOKU0056">Is your army the concern of Tokugawa? I think not.</String>
		<String _locID="66674" soundfilename="YTOKU0057">It seems we have misjudged our opponents. Or, perhaps I have chosen the wrong allies.</String>
		<String _locID="66675" soundfilename="YTOKU0058">Your lack of judgment has cost us a victory. Perhaps you should review your strategy.</String>
		<String _locID="66676" soundfilename="YTOKU0059">Tokugawa knows little about these Aztecs, only that they are not fit to stand before him.</String>
		<String _locID="66677" soundfilename="YTOKU0060">Send the Aztecs back to their homeland. Perhaps there they will find an equally miserable opponent.</String>
		<String _locID="66678" soundfilename="YTOKU0061">The British have always had dreams far greater than their abilities.</String>
		<String _locID="66679" soundfilename="YTOKU0062">The British sustain a barbaric culture. Their demise was expected.</String>
		<String _locID="66680" soundfilename="YTOKU0063">Did Tokugawa really just defeat the Dutch? It felt more like crushing insects.</String>
		<String _locID="66681" soundfilename="YTOKU0064">Tokugawa never understood the Dutch's bravado. They bleed as easily as anyone else.</String>
		<String _locID="66682" soundfilename="YTOKU0065">The Frenchmen are nothing but little boys. It is time for them to take a permanent nap.</String>
		<String _locID="66683" soundfilename="YTOKU0066">The French army will fertilize these lands for many years to come... as corpses.</String>
		<String _locID="66684" soundfilename="YTOKU0067">My theory has proven correct: German soldiers run like frightened children when faced with death.</String>
		<String _locID="66685" soundfilename="YTOKU0068">What is that stench? Of course! It is the smell of a bloody German army.</String>
		<String _locID="66686" soundfilename="YTOKU0069">The Iroquois may lord of their homeland, but this is Tokugawa's domain.</String>
		<String _locID="66687" soundfilename="YTOKU0070">The Iroquois should not have come to this land. They will return home in pieces.</String>
		<String _locID="66688" soundfilename="YTOKU0071">The Ottomans believed they could stand against the might of Tokugawa. They assumed incorrectly.</String>
		<String _locID="66689" soundfilename="YTOKU0072">We have crushed the Ottomans underfoot. The dust of their bones clings to my armor.</String>
		<String _locID="66690" soundfilename="YTOKU0073">If only the Portuguese had lived up to the promise of their fascinating weaponry.</String>
		<String _locID="66691" soundfilename="YTOKU0074">The Portuguese have fallen before Tokugawa, as so many have before them.</String>
		<String _locID="66692" soundfilename="YTOKU0075">Tokugawa has heard many stories of Russian might. It is a pity they were only stories.</String>
		<String _locID="66693" soundfilename="YTOKU0076">The Russians anger easy but die easier.</String>
		<String _locID="66694" soundfilename="YTOKU0077">The Sioux fight ferociously, but do so too late to matter.</String>
		<String _locID="66695" soundfilename="YTOKU0078">In the end, all armies submit to Tokugawa. Even the Sioux.</String>
		<String _locID="66696" soundfilename="YTOKU0079">The Spanish put up a pitiful fight. They will be nursing their wounds for generations.</String>
		<String _locID="66697" soundfilename="YTOKU0080">Sleep well, Spanish. Perhaps next time they will steer clear of our shores.</String>
		<String _locID="66698" soundfilename="YTOKU0081">I expected more from the Chinese. Yet, here stands Tokugawa, unchallenged.</String>
		<String _locID="66699" soundfilename="YTOKU0082">The Chinese are like beasts. Several strikes with a heavy stick, and they run yelping for home.</String>
		<String _locID="66700" soundfilename="YTOKU0083">Clearly, the Indians have neither the passion nor the power to march this battlefield.</String>
		<String _locID="66701" soundfilename="YTOKU0084">The screams of the Indians will fill Tokugawa's ears for many nights.</String>
		<String _locID="66702" soundfilename="YTOKU0085">These traitorous Japanese could not stand up to the will of the shogun. They will suffer an eternity's torment.</String>
		<String _locID="66703" soundfilename="YTOKU0086">The traitorous Japanese have been tamed. They will not forget the teaching of their new master...Tokugawa.</String>
		<String _locID="66704" soundfilename="YTOKU0087">The Aztecs show surprising power, but it matters little when they are bleeding to death.</String>
		<String _locID="66705" soundfilename="YTOKU0088">The Aztecs fight like Japanese. But they are not Japanese, which is why they will die.</String>
		<String _locID="66706" soundfilename="YTOKU0089">I fear the British warriors. Their western savagery suggests madness.</String>
		<String _locID="66707" soundfilename="YTOKU0090">If the British might is to be believed, we may wish to reexamine our strategy.</String>
		<String _locID="66708" soundfilename="YTOKU0091">I have never encountered a foe like these Dutch. A single shove will not knock them over.</String>
		<String _locID="66709" soundfilename="YTOKU0092">Do not underestimate the Dutch. Their blank expressions hide a bloodthirsty brutality.</String>
		<String _locID="66710" soundfilename="YTOKU0093">The French have a long history of warfare. Their experience is what guides them in this battle.</String>
		<String _locID="66711" soundfilename="YTOKU0094">If any Europeans are to be feared, it is the French. They have an imperialist's eye.</String>
		<String _locID="66712" soundfilename="YTOKU0095">These Germans will slog through blood and mud to destroy us. Kill first, fear later.</String>
		<String _locID="66713" soundfilename="YTOKU0096">The German war machine should be respected.and then dismantled.</String>
		<String _locID="66714" soundfilename="YTOKU0097">The Iroquois bring a passionate fervor to their warfare. I admire it.</String>
		<String _locID="66715" soundfilename="YTOKU0098">Tokugawa has respect for these Iroquois. They fight as if moved by the spirits.</String>
		<String _locID="66716" soundfilename="YTOKU0099">The Ottomans seem to survive on the blood of their enemies. They should be respected, and feared.</String>
		<String _locID="66717" soundfilename="YTOKU0100">It is as I feared. In the heat of battle, the Ottomans will do almost anything to achieve a victory.</String>
		<String _locID="66718" soundfilename="YTOKU0101">The might of the Portuguese rises like a blood red sun, casting a deathly shadow.</String>
		<String _locID="66719" soundfilename="YTOKU0102">Tokugawa did not expect the Portuguese to have such a ravenous appetite for war.</String>
		<String _locID="66720" soundfilename="YTOKU0103">With every step the Russians take, the earth shudders. They are more powerful than expected.</String>
		<String _locID="66721" soundfilename="YTOKU0104">The ferocity of the Russians is unparalleled. It will take much to stop them.</String>
		<String _locID="66722" soundfilename="YTOKU0105">Like a growing storm, the Sioux armies approach. Their numbers are like the stars.</String>
		<String _locID="66723" soundfilename="YTOKU0106">Tokugawa watches the Sioux warriors with worry. They fight like men with nothing to lose.</String>
		<String _locID="66724" soundfilename="YTOKU0107">The Spanish are well versed in the art of war. Do not dare take your eye off them.</String>
		<String _locID="66725" soundfilename="YTOKU0108">Tokugawa detests the Spanish warlords. For once, an army is actually worthy of his attention.</String>
		<String _locID="66726" soundfilename="YTOKU0109">The Chinese do not suffer defeat lightly. They laugh in the face of our samurai.</String>
		<String _locID="66727" soundfilename="YTOKU0110">Chinese warriors fight like devils. They will always advance, even as their entrails fall behind them.</String>
		<String _locID="66728" soundfilename="YTOKU0111">The Indians have a long history of triumph. We must proceed with caution.</String>
		<String _locID="66729" soundfilename="YTOKU0112">These Indians possess such strange weapons and tactics. They are a surprisingly fierce opponent.</String>
		<String _locID="66730" soundfilename="YTOKU0113">Tokugawa once called these traitorous Japanese his allies. They are men of great skill, and greater treachery.</String>
		<String _locID="66731" soundfilename="YTOKU0114">Tokugawa is surprised at these traitorous Japanese. They are strong, and will fight for nothing short of a victory.</String>
		<String _locID="66732" soundfilename="YTOKU0115">Do not turn our alliance into a competition. Remember. You serve Tokugawa.</String>
		<String _locID="66733" soundfilename="YTOKU0116">Your advances will greatly aid my army. That is the reason you pursue them, is it not?</String>
		<String _locID="66734" soundfilename="YTOKU0117">The enemy enlists the aid of natives. Beware. They hope to turn the whole region against us.</String>
		<String _locID="66735" soundfilename="YTOKU0118">Natives flock to our enemy. They must sense a weakness in our alliance, meaning you.</String>
		<String _locID="66736" soundfilename="YTOKU0119">Farmers will not win this war for Tokugawa. Advance quickly or you will perish.</String>
		<String _locID="66737" soundfilename="YTOKU0120">Tokugawa's samurai will not fight alongside farmers. Why have you not advanced?</String>
		<String _locID="66738" soundfilename="YTOKU0121">Cease hiding in your headquarters and join the battle at hand. The world advances without you.</String>
		<String _locID="66739" soundfilename="YTOKU0122">Your ignorance is appalling. Tokugawa has chosen you as his ally. Advance!</String>
		<String _locID="66740" soundfilename="YTOKU0123">Excellent. Your advanced civilization will greatly aid Tokugawa in his dominance.</String>
		<String _locID="66741" soundfilename="YTOKU0124">Your people as not as backwards as they appear. This advancement is good news.</String>
		<String _locID="66742" soundfilename="YTOKU0125">At last. You are even more ignorant than expected. Tokugawa is ashamed to have you as an ally.</String>
		<String _locID="66743" soundfilename="YTOKU0126">Your civilization advances at last. Your feeble people must still eat their rice uncooked.</String>
		<String _locID="66744" soundfilename="YTOKU0127">Many thanks for rescuing my monk. You have proven your usefulness to Tokugawa.</String>
		<String _locID="66745" soundfilename="YTOKU0128">You have done well. It is bad luck to abandon a holy man.</String>
		<String _locID="66746" soundfilename="YTOKU0129">Tokugawa has dismissed another threat. If only you were so effective.</String>
		<String _locID="66747" soundfilename="YTOKU0130">Fools. Our enemies were fools to believe they had conquered the conqueror.</String>
		<String _locID="66748" soundfilename="YTOKU0131">These native villages burn so brightly. It is beautiful.</String>
		<String _locID="66749" soundfilename="YTOKU0132">One more native enemy has fallen by the wayside.</String>
		<String _locID="66750" soundfilename="YTOKU0133">It is done. Tokugawa marches on, devastation and chaos in his wake.</String>
		<String _locID="66751" soundfilename="YTOKU0134">It is over. A town that once housed the living, now houses the dead.</String>
		<String _locID="66752" soundfilename="YTOKU0135">Sever the ties to wealth, sever the ties to power. A trading post burns before Tokugawa.</String>
		<String _locID="66753" soundfilename="YTOKU0136">Follow Tokugawa's example, and tear the enemy's trade from this land.</String>
		<String _locID="66754" soundfilename="YTOKU0137">The natives fight ferociously. They will regret this resistance.</String>
		<String _locID="66755" soundfilename="YTOKU0138">It is ignorant not to accept the inevitable. Tokugawa will have that village yet.</String>
		<String _locID="66756" soundfilename="YTOKU0139">Destiny has not chosen this time for victory. Next time, perhaps.</String>
		<String _locID="66757" soundfilename="YTOKU0140">Tokugawa thought you were his ally. Where were your men during this disaster?</String>
		<String _locID="66758" soundfilename="YTOKU0141">The enemy's trade route is well defended. Our priorities shift elsewhere.for now.</String>
		<String _locID="66759" soundfilename="YTOKU0142">The enemy passionately defends its trade route. Now we know what he treasures most.</String>
		<String _locID="66760" soundfilename="YTOKU0143">Tokugawa does not worship, but the death of a believer is always cause for reflection.</String>
		<String _locID="66761" soundfilename="YTOKU0144">The death of a monk strikes a dual blow. We lose his blessing, as well as his treasure.</String>
		<String _locID="66762" soundfilename="YTOKU0145">This is why beasts have no soul. They prey on the enlightened.</String>
		<String _locID="66763" soundfilename="YTOKU0146">My poor monk must have angered that beast in a former life.</String>
		<String _locID="66764" soundfilename="YTOKU0147">It grows clear that this battle is not in Tokugawa's interests. For it is not defeat when the fight is meaningless.</String>
		<String _locID="66765" soundfilename="YTOKU0148">Even the strongest commander grows weary of wasting his time. Is this battle finished yet?</String>
		<String _locID="66766" soundfilename="YTOKU0149">The blood of my clan is being spilled. Send your men before it is too late.</String>
		<String _locID="66767" soundfilename="YTOKU0150">Hurry. Tokugawa's men should not die when yours would be a much better substitute.</String>
		<String _locID="66768" soundfilename="YTOKU0151">The servants of Tokugawa scatter! Is this what an alliance means to you? Where are your men?</String>
		<String _locID="66769" soundfilename="YTOKU0152">My fiercest samurai have fallen in this onslaught. Ally, I come to you for help.</String>
		<String _locID="66770" soundfilename="YTOKU0153">Greetings. You must be the newest servant of Tokugawa.</String>
		<String _locID="66771" soundfilename="YTOKU0154">Tokugawa expects great things from you. Do not disappoint him.</String>
		<String _locID="66772" soundfilename="YTOKU0155">If you shut your mouth and open your ears, you may one day be as mighty as Tokugawa.</String>
		<String _locID="66773" soundfilename="YTOKU0156">You choose a challenge. Tokugawa prefers an ally willing to face his fears.</String>
		<String _locID="66774" soundfilename="YTOKU0157">Only with Tokugawa's help will you ever overcome this deadly challenge.</String>
		<String _locID="66775" soundfilename="YTOKU0158">Tokugawa does not like an ally who sets his sights so low.</String>
		<String _locID="66776" soundfilename="YTOKU0159">You choose the simple path. War should inspire a warrior to surpass his expectations, not forget them.</String>
		<String _locID="66777" soundfilename="YTOKU0160">Yes, I remember you. I often dreamt of removing your head and placing it in on a platter.</String>
		<String _locID="66778" soundfilename="YTOKU0161">Last we met, you resorted to deceit and trickery. Those are not the ways of the warrior.</String>
		<String _locID="66779" soundfilename="YTOKU0162">It is good that fate has brought us together again. You proved your worth when last we drew swords together.</String>
		<String _locID="66780" soundfilename="YTOKU0163">Your armies performed admirably during our last alliance. Tokugawa was almost impressed.</String>
		<String _locID="66781" soundfilename="YTOKU0164">Tokugawa thought he had buried your severed head in his garden. Strange. It must have been someone else's.</String>
		<String _locID="66782" soundfilename="YTOKU0165">Once again we face a common enemy. Try to keep up with Tokugawa this time.</String>
		<String _locID="66783" soundfilename="YTOKU0166">Do you remember this place? Last we gazed upon it the sky was black with the smoke of a conquered enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="66784" soundfilename="YTOKU0167">Let us hope this engagement fares better than our last.</String>
		<String _locID="66785" soundfilename="YTOKU0168">Tokugawa expects great things from you, unlike last time.</String>
		<String _locID="66786" soundfilename="YTOKU0169">It is rare for Tokugawa to respect another commander, but you have earned it.</String>
		<String _locID="66787" soundfilename="YTOKU0170">Finally, Tokugawa has an ally in which to place some confidence. Even if it is only a little.</String>
		<String _locID="66788" soundfilename="YTOKU0171">Ransom is fine, but Tokugawa prefers to make his deals on the battlefield.</String>
		<String _locID="66789" soundfilename="YTOKU0172">Tokugawa has paid for his monk's freedom. This will not be a regular occurrence.</String>
		<String _locID="66790" soundfilename="YTOKU0173">No amount of coin is worth more to me than a monk.</String>
		<String _locID="66791" soundfilename="YTOKU0174">It is unjust to hold a holy man against his will. They must always be rescued.</String>
		<String _locID="66792" soundfilename="YTOKU0175">Tokugawa has liberated a monk, both his body and his spirit.</String>
		<String _locID="66793" soundfilename="YTOKU0176">Today, our warriors have shown their faith. They have rescued a monk in need.</String>
		<String _locID="66794" soundfilename="YTOKU0177">String your bows, and sharpen your blades! The enemy has shown us an undefended target!</String>
		<String _locID="66795" soundfilename="YTOKU0178">Only an inexperienced opponent would leave a headquarters undefended. It is time for an education.</String>
		<String _locID="66796" soundfilename="YTOKU0179">Interesting. A town center without a barracks in sight. Like a fruit ripe for the plucking.</String>
		<String _locID="66797" soundfilename="YTOKU0180">Even if the enemy wanted to muster their defenses, they have no barracks to do so. Fate sides with us.</String>
		<String _locID="66798" soundfilename="YTOKU0181">The enemy town center lies alone, with no horses to ride to its aid.</String>
		<String _locID="66799" soundfilename="YTOKU0182">Their headquarters lacks a stable to protect it. This is our time to strike.</String>
		<String _locID="66800" soundfilename="YTOKU0183">Allow Tokugawa to bless you with a shower of gold.</String>
		<String _locID="66801" soundfilename="YTOKU0184">I hope you use your coin more wisely than you use your warriors.</String>
		<String _locID="66802" soundfilename="YTOKU0185">Tokugawa has such wealth that this donation goes without notice.</String>
		<String _locID="66803" soundfilename="YTOKU0186">All good things come from your benevolent master, Tokugawa.</String>
		<String _locID="66804" soundfilename="YTOKU0187">Your men look like skeletons. Take this food to nourish them.</String>
		<String _locID="66805" soundfilename="YTOKU0188">You may have your wood...but do not forget this favor.</String>
		<String _locID="66806" soundfilename="YTOKU0189">Wood is one resource Tokugawa can spare.</String>
		<String _locID="66807" soundfilename="YTOKU0190">Come, Tokugawa's men march on the enemy headquarters. This is no time for indecision.</String>
		<String _locID="66808" soundfilename="YTOKU0191">The time has come to strike. Prepare for battle. This is not a request. It is an order.</String>
		<String _locID="66809" soundfilename="YTOKU0192">Innocent villagers make such easy targets. That is because they are unarmed.</String>
		<String _locID="66810" soundfilename="YTOKU0193">The enemy's villagers do not expect an attack, which is exactly why one is coming.</String>
		<String _locID="66811" soundfilename="YTOKU0194">Tokugawa will crush the enemy's villagers like leaves under his foot.</String>
		<String _locID="66812" soundfilename="YTOKU0195">It is time to pounce, while the enemy's young struggle blindly in its den. Show no mercy.</String>
		<String _locID="66813" soundfilename="YTOKU0196">The armies of Tokugawa march on the enemy capital. Would you like to join him in this butchery?</String>
		<String _locID="66814" soundfilename="YTOKU0197">I begin my attack. The enemy does not expect such a blow, which is why it will be so enjoyable.</String>
		<String _locID="66815" soundfilename="YTOKU0198">A blood wind blows. Tokugawa prepares to clean the country of these traitorous natives.</String>
		<String _locID="66816" soundfilename="YTOKU0199">Natives who side with the enemy are certain to feel Tokugawa's wrath. We march!</String>
		<String _locID="66817" soundfilename="YTOKU0200">After this assault, the enemy's trading post will be but a scar upon the land.</String>
		<String _locID="66818" soundfilename="YTOKU0201">I am advancing on the enemy trade route. Keep an eye open for ambushes.</String>
		<String _locID="66819" soundfilename="YTOKU0202">To battle! Together, our warriors will turn the tide against our enemies.</String>
		<String _locID="66820" soundfilename="YTOKU0203">It was a difficult decision, but Tokugawa has decided to reinforce your army.</String>
		<String _locID="66821" soundfilename="YTOKU0204">Tokugawa's armies march to you. As a united force, we will trample the enemy into dust.</String>
		<String _locID="66822" soundfilename="YTOKU0205">This is a good place for a barracks. Tokugawa's engine of war will turn these skies gray.</String>
		<String _locID="66823" soundfilename="YTOKU0206">This spot will be remembered. Today, a dynasty breaks new ground.</String>
		<String _locID="66824" soundfilename="YTOKU0207">The wrath of Tokugawa shall radiate from this dusty patch of earth. We build!</String>
		<String _locID="66825" soundfilename="YTOKU0208">A ruler must have a castle. Tokugawa will build his here.</String>
		<String _locID="66826" soundfilename="YTOKU0209">With this town center, a dynasty dawns.</String>
		<String _locID="66827" soundfilename="YTOKU0210">Such a beautiful sight. From here I will look out over my dynasty.</String>
		<String _locID="66828" soundfilename="YTOKU0211">This native settlement will belong to Tokugawa. The will of its people begs to be broken.</String>
		<String _locID="66829" soundfilename="YTOKU0212">A village lies in the path of Tokugawa's march. It will be removed.</String>
		<String _locID="66830" soundfilename="YTOKU0213">All who do not bow down, will burn. These natives have made the right choice.</String>
		<String _locID="66831" soundfilename="YTOKU0214">Tokugawa wishes to take a trade site. No one will stand in his way.</String>
		<String _locID="66832" soundfilename="YTOKU0215">It is important to keep our trade flowing. Capturing this trading post will surely help.</String>
		<String _locID="66833" soundfilename="YTOKU0216">A warrior does not leave his palaces undefended. Here, we fight.</String>
		<String _locID="66834" soundfilename="YTOKU0217">The only way this building will be captured, is over the smoking bodies of its garrison.</String>
		<String _locID="66835" soundfilename="YTOKU0218">You may turn and flee, but Tokugawa will never choose retreat.</String>
		<String _locID="66836" soundfilename="YTOKU0219">Learn from my example. True warriors fight to the death to defend their positions.</String>
		<String _locID="66837" soundfilename="YTOKU0220">This native settlement has become vital to our plans. It will be defended.</String>
		<String _locID="66838" soundfilename="YTOKU0221">This settlement will be defended. Tokugawa does not abandon his allies. Unless, of course, they displease him.</String>
		<String _locID="66839" soundfilename="YTOKU0222">People must know that their master watches over them. That is why this village will be defended.</String>
		<String _locID="66840" soundfilename="YTOKU0223">Our men prepare their defenses. The enemy will swat this busy village and find it a beehive.</String>
		<String _locID="66841" soundfilename="YTOKU0224">Pay attention! This trade site must be defended. Your assistance may be required.</String>
		<String _locID="66842" soundfilename="YTOKU0225">Tokugawa would like to see the enemy tear this trade site from his grasp.</String>
		<String _locID="66843" soundfilename="YTOKU0226">Tokugawa will supply coin for as long as you require it. Spend this wealth wisely.</String>
		<String _locID="66844" soundfilename="YTOKU0227">The riches of Tokugawa are abundant. He will support your army, even when you cannot.</String>
		<String _locID="66845" soundfilename="YTOKU0228">Your men will not starve with Tokugawa as a benefactor.</String>
		<String _locID="66846" soundfilename="YTOKU0229">Do not disappoint Tokugawa. Wood will flow only as long as you deserve it.</String>
		<String _locID="66847" soundfilename="YTOKU0230">The warriors of Tokugawa march to rescue their ally. And remember, favors are meant to be repaid.</String>
		<String _locID="66848" soundfilename="YTOKU0231">Tokugawa has too much invested in you. His men rally to your defense.</String>
		<String _locID="66849" soundfilename="YTOKU0232">Do not waver in the winds of your enemy. Tokugawa has sent his men to support you.</String>
		<String _locID="66850" soundfilename="YTOKU0233">No one ignores Tokugawa! Address your allies or lose them!</String>
		<String _locID="66851" soundfilename="YTOKU0234">How can allies plan when allies do not communicate? Open your mouth or Tokugawa will open your belly.</String>
		<String _locID="66852" soundfilename="YTOKU0235">Tokugawa requires coin. Give it to him.</String>
		<String _locID="66853" soundfilename="YTOKU0236">Tokugawa has granted you many favors. It is time to return this goodwill with coin.</String>
		<String _locID="66854" soundfilename="YTOKU0237">Tokugawa's army requires food. You must accommodate or face the consequences.</String>
		<String _locID="66855" soundfilename="YTOKU0238">You must spare some food. Tokugawa's men starve. They will eat anything.</String>
		<String _locID="66856" soundfilename="YTOKU0239">Our villages lie stagnant. A donation of wood would enable their growth.</String>
		<String _locID="66857" soundfilename="YTOKU0240">A gift of wood is needed to keep the fires of war burning.</String>
		<String _locID="66858" soundfilename="YTOKU0241">Do you hear Tokugawa's sigh of relief? Your warriors' assistance is appreciated.</String>
		<String _locID="66859" soundfilename="YTOKU0242">The clouds over this battle lift. Tokugawa expresses his thanks and gratitude.</String>
		<String _locID="66860" soundfilename="YTOKU0243">Thank you. But Tokugawa always had control of the situation.</String>
		<String _locID="66861" soundfilename="YTOKU0244">This coin is a welcome relief.</String>
		<String _locID="66862" soundfilename="YTOKU0245">This gift will not be forgotten.</String>
		<String _locID="66863" soundfilename="YTOKU0246">Your food saved Tokugawa's men from starvation.</String>
		<String _locID="66864" soundfilename="YTOKU0247">The food was a blessing. Men cannot fight with hollow bellies.</String>
		<String _locID="66865" soundfilename="YTOKU0248">Look around you. Our dead lie side by side. This defense will be forever celebrated.</String>
		<String _locID="66866" soundfilename="YTOKU0249">This battle could not have been won without your friendship. Perhaps I underestimated you.</String>
		<String _locID="66867" soundfilename="YTOKU0250">You have helped save Tokugawa's capital. Your warriors will always be heroes in these lands.</String>
		<String _locID="66868" soundfilename="YTOKU0251">Tokugawa favors the loyal. He will not forget your generous donations.</String>
		<String _locID="66869" soundfilename="YTOKU0252">This act proves your worthiness to Tokugawa.</String>
		<String _locID="66870" soundfilename="YTOKU0253">Thank you. Wood is always welcome in a warrior's camp.</String>
		<String _locID="66871" soundfilename="YTOKU0254">Thank you. Archers without wood are like wolves without teeth.</String>
		<String _locID="66872" soundfilename="YTOKU0255">The Aztecs repel our forces. Who would have expected such resistance?</String>
		<String _locID="66873" soundfilename="YTOKU0256">Inspire your warriors, or the Aztec assault will surely swallow us.</String>
		<String _locID="66874" soundfilename="YTOKU0257">The British will claim victory if we do not adapt to their wiles. They are clever killers.</String>
		<String _locID="66875" soundfilename="YTOKU0258">Where do the British find such men? For they fight like demons!</String>
		<String _locID="66876" soundfilename="YTOKU0259">Tokugawa has never seen such a hunger for blood. The Dutch seem to feast on our dead.</String>
		<String _locID="66877" soundfilename="YTOKU0260">We fall before the Dutch tide, like crops to the harvest.</String>
		<String _locID="66878" soundfilename="YTOKU0261">How can this be? The French have their knives to Tokugawa's throat.</String>
		<String _locID="66879" soundfilename="YTOKU0262">Every French arrow finds its target. This nation is stronger than anticipated.</String>
		<String _locID="66880" soundfilename="YTOKU0263">Our blood coats the Germans' blades. We are being driven back at every turn.</String>
		<String _locID="66881" soundfilename="YTOKU0264">Every German warrior is worth three of our men. They do not know the meaning of defeat.</String>
		<String _locID="66882" soundfilename="YTOKU0265">In another life, Tokugawa would stand in awe of the Iroquois. For now, he retreats.</String>
		<String _locID="66883" soundfilename="YTOKU0266">The Iroquois warriors sink their claws into the countryside. They are predators by nature.</String>
		<String _locID="66884" soundfilename="YTOKU0267">The Ottoman armies pick their teeth with the bones of our dead.</String>
		<String _locID="66885" soundfilename="YTOKU0268">Tokugawa fears few things. But he fears the Ottomans. They have given him good reason to.</String>
		<String _locID="66886" soundfilename="YTOKU0269">The Portuguese kill our men by the hundreds. They are a force of nature.</String>
		<String _locID="66887" soundfilename="YTOKU0270">This fight turns against us. Your strange fear of the Portugese is costing us this war.</String>
		<String _locID="66888" soundfilename="YTOKU0271">These Russians know no fear. They shrug off every one of our blows.</String>
		<String _locID="66889" soundfilename="YTOKU0272">The Russian tide flattens our men. Their thirst for blood is unmatched.</String>
		<String _locID="66890" soundfilename="YTOKU0273">A mad fire drives the Sioux. We must be more careful or we will lose this war.</String>
		<String _locID="66891" soundfilename="YTOKU0274">Every time our men march forward, the Sioux send them scrambling back. They are a mighty race.</String>
		<String _locID="66892" soundfilename="YTOKU0275">Tokugawa does not know how to stop the Spanish attack. They could march through hell unscathed.</String>
		<String _locID="66893" soundfilename="YTOKU0276">The Spanish are surprisingly skilled in combat. Our men must do more to resist them.</String>
		<String _locID="66894" soundfilename="YTOKU0277">The Chinese turn the knife in Tokugawa's side. Their lack of mercy is their strength.</String>
		<String _locID="66895" soundfilename="YTOKU0278">We are buried under the Chinese avalanche. If we do not act fast, we will suffocate.</String>
		<String _locID="66896" soundfilename="YTOKU0279">The Indians fight like Japanese, which is why Tokugawa finds them so difficult to defeat.</String>
		<String _locID="66897" soundfilename="YTOKU0280">Tokugawa will never kneel to the Indians, not even with a sword at his neck.</String>
		<String _locID="66898" soundfilename="YTOKU0281">We falter in the face of the traitorous Japanese. This day must not end in defeat.</String>
		<String _locID="66899" soundfilename="YTOKU0282">The traitorous Japanese win many victories. But defeat only strengthens Tokugawa's resolve.</String>
		<String _locID="66900" soundfilename="YTOKU0283">Our men may die, but the Aztecs cannot continue at this pace. We must stay alive a little longer.</String>
		<String _locID="66901" soundfilename="YTOKU0284">The British know how to fight, but with every push, they gasp and weaken.</String>
		<String _locID="66902" soundfilename="YTOKU0285">There is a light behind this darkness. In forcing the offensive, the Dutch leave themselves vulnerable.</String>
		<String _locID="66903" soundfilename="YTOKU0286">We are losing, but there is still hope. For every warrior the French slay, we kill two of theirs.</String>
		<String _locID="66904" soundfilename="YTOKU0287">The Germans win, but they also weaken. All is not lost. We must remain strong against this threat.</String>
		<String _locID="66905" soundfilename="YTOKU0288">Hope springs as our blood spills. The Iroquois have wasted their manpower.</String>
		<String _locID="66906" soundfilename="YTOKU0289">Defeat lingers in the shadows, but Tokugawa will never stop fighting. The Ottomans grow weary.</String>
		<String _locID="66907" soundfilename="YTOKU0290">The Portuguese rush over us, but quickly tire. Strike now, while they are out of breath.</String>
		<String _locID="66908" soundfilename="YTOKU0291">The Russians bruise us, but they are too weak for the kill. We will counterattack and finish them.</String>
		<String _locID="66909" soundfilename="YTOKU0292">The Sioux cannot keep up this crushing intensity. When their armies waver, we will show them the meaning of pain.</String>
		<String _locID="66910" soundfilename="YTOKU0293">Our men fall before the Spanish charge. Outlasting them is our only hope of survival.</String>
		<String _locID="66911" soundfilename="YTOKU0294">The Chinese have shown their strength; but even the strongest must rest. Our time for vengeance grows near.</String>
		<String _locID="66912" soundfilename="YTOKU0295">If we must die, then we will do so fighting. The Indians will fall around us in a flurry of blood and metal.</String>
		<String _locID="66913" soundfilename="YTOKU0296">The traitorous Japanese spill our blood, but we spill theirs as well. Soon they will run dry.</String>
		<String _locID="66914" soundfilename="YTOKU0297">Tokugawa's strength has vanished, but yours remains. Lend him aid, or face his fate.</String>
		<String _locID="66915" soundfilename="YTOKU0298">Know this. If Tokugawa falls, he will take you with him. Allies should combine their power, not hoard it.</String>
		<String _locID="66916" soundfilename="YTOKU0299">Do not worry. As long as Tokugawa can raise his sword, the outcome remains a mystery.</String>
		<String _locID="66917" soundfilename="YTOKU0300">The enemy does great damage, but only to the weak. Tokugawa feels nothing.</String>
		<String _locID="66918" soundfilename="YTOKU0301">We tower over our enemies, triumphant.</String>
		<String _locID="66919" soundfilename="YTOKU0302">Our enemies do not stand a chance against the fury of our alliance.</String>
		<String _locID="66920" soundfilename="YTOKU0303">We may dominate, but Tokugawa's weakness shows who has been making the sacrifices in this war.</String>
		<String _locID="66921" soundfilename="YTOKU0304">Even as this battle rages, you turn your lustful eyes to Tokugawa's dynasty. Power like yours is fleeting, my ally.</String>
		<String _locID="66922" soundfilename="YTOKU0305">Our success on the battlefield is a result of Tokugawa's prowess, nothing more.</String>
		<String _locID="66923" soundfilename="YTOKU0306">This battle is evidence of Tokugawa's supreme rule. Everyone, including you, will one day submit.</String>
		<String _locID="66924" soundfilename="YTOKU0307">Tokugawa fears for this alliance. Our soldiers' numbers dwindle, their courage wanes.</String>
		<String _locID="66925" soundfilename="YTOKU0308">You must improve your strategy. Our alliance nears the point of no return.</String>
		<String _locID="66926" soundfilename="YTOKU0309">Tokugawa's might wavers. How has it come to this?</String>
		<String _locID="66927" soundfilename="YTOKU0310">Something must be done. These defeats go beyond humiliation.</String>
		<String _locID="66928" soundfilename="YTOKU0311">This may be the end of the Tokugawa dynasty. If so, the world will mourn.</String>
		<String _locID="66929" soundfilename="YTOKU0312">Under a dark cloud of death, a dynasty fades. Even Tokugawa cannot resist this dark destiny.</String>
		<String _locID="66930" soundfilename="YTOKU0313">Our enemy seeks to claim every inch of this land. We must destroy those chokepoints.</String>
		<String _locID="66931" soundfilename="YTOKU0314">They hope to stall our victory with tricks. This threat must be terminated quickly.</String>
		<String _locID="66932" soundfilename="YTOKU0315">Our enemy poisons the natives with promises of power. They will pay for this betrayal.</String>
		<String _locID="66933" soundfilename="YTOKU0316">The enemy hopes to win the land by winning the people. This cannot happen.</String>
		<String _locID="66934" soundfilename="YTOKU0317">The enemy's men scurry across the map like mice. They must not claim more territory.</String>
		<String _locID="66935" soundfilename="YTOKU0318">Tokugawa is shocked by the audacity of his enemies. You must do something.</String>
		<String _locID="66936" soundfilename="YTOKU0319">We must work faster. Our enemy befriends the natives at a surprising pace.</String>
		<String _locID="66937" soundfilename="YTOKU0320">Every time the enemy seizes a village, we become villains in the eyes of its people.</String>
		<String _locID="66938" soundfilename="YTOKU0321">The enemy grows roots all across the land. Act now, ally, or you will regret it.</String>
		<String _locID="66939" soundfilename="YTOKU0322">A warrior does not nap as the enemy marches over him. Open your eyes, fool, and fight!</String>
		<String _locID="66940" soundfilename="YTOKU0323">You toy with natives? They have little to offer but superstitions.</String>
		<String _locID="66941" soundfilename="YTOKU0324">You have formed a bond with natives. Tokugawa is pleased. He enjoys exploitation.</String>
		<String _locID="66942" soundfilename="YTOKU0325">An eye for trade is wise. Building an army requires the right resources.</String>
		<String _locID="66943" soundfilename="YTOKU0326">You have brought more lands under the banner of Tokugawa. Every inch counts.</String>
		<String _locID="66944" soundfilename="YTOKU0327">Well done. Such swiftness is an asset.</String>
		<String _locID="66945" soundfilename="YTOKU0328">Is your haste meant to intimidate Tokugawa? Be careful not to offend.</String>
		<String _locID="66946" soundfilename="YTOKU0329">Each contribution to the effort is appreciated.</String>
		<String _locID="66947" soundfilename="YTOKU0330">Your strategy does not go unrecognized. This land holds many treasures.</String>
		<String _locID="66948" soundfilename="YTOKU0331">Good fortune finds you. Now yield some of it to Tokugawa.</String>
		<String _locID="66949" soundfilename="YTOKU0332">You find one more treasure...for the chests of Tokugawa.</String>
		<String _locID="66950" soundfilename="YTOKU0333">You find food. Excellent. The stronger the servant, the stronger the master.</String>
		<String _locID="66951" soundfilename="YTOKU0334">This is good. Now Tokugawa knows where to go when his men beg for bread.</String>
		<String _locID="66952" soundfilename="YTOKU0335">Focus your efforts on the fight, not on your coffers. Treasure hunting is for fools.</String>
		<String _locID="66953" soundfilename="YTOKU0336">Tokugawa does not participate in childish races for treasure.</String>
		<String _locID="66954" soundfilename="YTOKU0337">A man does not pick his ally's pocket. If you value your hand, you will keep it on your own property.</String>
		<String _locID="66955" soundfilename="YTOKU0338">Be careful where you search for treasure. Allies can easily become enemies.</String>
		<String _locID="66956" soundfilename="YTOKU0339">You bring more warriors to the fold. Remind them who is the true master of this army...Tokugawa.</String>
		<String _locID="66957" soundfilename="YTOKU0340">These men are not samurai, but they will make nice fodder. Push them to the front.</String>
		<String _locID="66958" soundfilename="YTOKU0341">Villagers are like cattle. Every beast should be put to use.</String>
		<String _locID="66959" soundfilename="YTOKU0342">Villagers are good, but warriors are better.</String>
		<String _locID="66960" soundfilename="YTOKU0343">Leave some wood for Tokugawa. Are we not allies?</String>
		<String _locID="66961" soundfilename="YTOKU0344">You do plan to share that wood with Tokugawa, correct?</String>
		<String _locID="66962" soundfilename="YTOKU0345">Natives are useful. They have a great talent for stopping the arrows of the enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="66963" soundfilename="YTOKU0346">Wise move. Natives are the best resource of all. Obedient and easily replaced.</String>
		<String _locID="66964" soundfilename="YTOKU0347">Thanks to your rapid advance, we command the map's trade route. Well done.</String>
		<String _locID="66965" soundfilename="YTOKU0348">It is wise to pursue trade sites. Tokugawa's doubts about you begin to fade.very slowly.</String>
		<String _locID="66966" soundfilename="YTOKU0349">Tokugawa will not take your walls personally. As long as his men still have access to your domain.</String>
		<String _locID="66967" soundfilename="YTOKU0350">Tokugawa sees your construction. But walls will not protect you from your own stupidity and lack of leadership.</String>
		<String _locID="66968" soundfilename="YTOKU0351">A native province yields to Tokugawa.</String>
		<String _locID="66969" soundfilename="YTOKU0352">These natives will act as our guides in this unknown land.</String>
		<String _locID="66970" soundfilename="YTOKU0353">This trade site appears deserted. Tokugawa shall claim it as his own.</String>
		<String _locID="66971" soundfilename="YTOKU0354">This is a helpful find. Every log, every coin, every loaf, is appreciated.</String>
		<String _locID="66972" soundfilename="YTOKU0355">Our storehouses overflow with an abundance of treasures.</String>
		<String _locID="66973" soundfilename="YTOKU0356">Every coin we gather is a coin stolen from our enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="66974" soundfilename="YTOKU0357">With so many riches, Tokugawa hardly notices the new additions.</String>
		<String _locID="66975" soundfilename="YTOKU0358">The fire to kill requires fuel. This food will do nicely.</String>
		<String _locID="66976" soundfilename="YTOKU0359">Were you planning to gather those riches? Next time you should move more quickly.</String>
		<String _locID="66977" soundfilename="YTOKU0360">Tokugawa will take this small treasure away from you, for safe keeping.</String>
		<String _locID="66978" soundfilename="YTOKU0361">Tokugawa knows that this is not a contest, but still, his riches put yours to shame.</String>
		<String _locID="66979" soundfilename="YTOKU0362">Not only are your men weak, but they are also poor. Gather more treasures.</String>
		<String _locID="66980" soundfilename="YTOKU0363">I have found more warriors. There is no greater treasure than men willing to die for their master.</String>
		<String _locID="66981" soundfilename="YTOKU0364">These native warriors may be wild, but they are warriors nonetheless.</String>
		<String _locID="66982" soundfilename="YTOKU0365">Villagers are always welcome. There is always work to be done.</String>
		<String _locID="66983" soundfilename="YTOKU0366">Villagers are good for many things, all of them for the glory of Tokugawa.</String>
		<String _locID="66984" soundfilename="YTOKU0367">Every log gathered is another hail of arrows.</String>
		<String _locID="66985" soundfilename="YTOKU0368">Tokugawa does not take any blessing of wood for granted.</String>
		<String _locID="66986" soundfilename="YTOKU0369">Despite their bizarre rituals, every native on our side is an ally.</String>
		<String _locID="66987" soundfilename="YTOKU0370">Each trade site brings us closer to total dominance.</String>
		<String _locID="66988" soundfilename="YTOKU0371">We have snatched another trade site. Our eyes remain trained on victory.</String>
		<String _locID="66989" soundfilename="YTOKU0372">I shall build a wall to keep out the unwanted, like my enemies.and you.</String>
		<String _locID="66990" soundfilename="YTOKU0373">My walls are meant to keep out the enemy. So stay in my favor, or else.</String>
		<String _locID="66991" soundfilename="YTOKU0374">This victory has come about too easily, even for a righteous, wise, and all-powerful ruler like Tokugawa.</String>
		<String _locID="66992" soundfilename="YTOKU0375">The advantage is ours. Now we wait for our enemy to panic. Tokugawa enjoys when enemies panic.</String>
		<String _locID="66993" soundfilename="YTOKU0376">How could you possibly have become a worse ally than the last time we fought? It is pathetic.</String>
		<String _locID="66994" soundfilename="YTOKU0377">Not every warrior benefits from experience. It is obvious that some, like you, are cursed to fail.</String>
		<String _locID="66995" soundfilename="YTOKU0378">Tokugawa wonders how many heads had to roll to bring you such status.</String>
		<String _locID="66996" soundfilename="YTOKU0379">Many must have fallen at your feet. Tokugawa respects those who step to greatness on the backs of others.</String>
		<String _locID="66997" soundfilename="YTOKU0380">You have changed. A commander now stands before Tokugawa, when before there was only a whelp.</String>
		<String _locID="66998" soundfilename="YTOKU0381">You have been scarred by your experiences, but emerged stronger from them.</String>
		<String _locID="66999" soundfilename="YTOKU0382">Tokugawa will live on in the hearts of his people. There, you will never claim victory.</String>
		<String _locID="67000" soundfilename="YTOKU0383">This war is far from over. Every night the sun sets, only to rise again in the morning.</String>
		<String _locID="67001" soundfilename="YTOKU0384">Do not let sorrow overtake you. Your defeat is good news, for only death can cure a fool.</String>
		<String _locID="67002" soundfilename="YTOKU0385">Tell me. How does it feel to teeter on the brink of despair?</String>
		<String _locID="67003" soundfilename="YTOKU0386">The bloodier a battle, the better. There is no glory but that which is won in the mud.</String>
		<String _locID="67004" soundfilename="YTOKU0387">This battle should delight you. You will be remembered as a hero. A dead hero, but a hero nonetheless.</String>
		<String _locID="67005" soundfilename="YTOKU0388">Do not celebrate yet. Tokugawa has many more swords with which to slay you.</String>
		<String _locID="67006" soundfilename="YTOKU0389">Strange. You have won a battle. Never did Tokugawa consider such a possibility.</String>
		<String _locID="67007" soundfilename="YTOKU0390">One victory in many battles is like a drop of water in an endless ocean.</String>
		<String _locID="67008" soundfilename="YTOKU0391">This was the obvious outcome. It is a pity you had to waste so many men.</String>
		<String _locID="67009" soundfilename="YTOKU0392">Each step brings Tokugawa closer to his destiny.</String>
		<String _locID="67010" soundfilename="YTOKU0393">Another easy battle. Tell me, what do you hope to accomplish by dying?</String>
		<String _locID="67011" soundfilename="YTOKU0394">Bow to Tokugawa now, and you may be spared.</String>
		<String _locID="67012" soundfilename="YTOKU0395">Do you not see the twilight of your empire? Strange. Tokugawa sees it quite clearly.</String>
		<String _locID="67013" soundfilename="YTOKU0396">Like trained beasts, the allies of Tokugawa arrive on command.</String>
		<String _locID="67014" soundfilename="YTOKU0397">You see, only the strong side with Tokugawa. So it is only natural that you and he are enemies.</String>
		<String _locID="67015" soundfilename="YTOKU0398">There is no honor when two armies descend upon one. It is the strategy of a feeble mind.</String>
		<String _locID="67016" soundfilename="YTOKU0399">With this, your ally assures his death. I will save space by using one grave for both of your bodies.</String>
		<String _locID="67017" soundfilename="YTOKU0400">Knowledge and progress mean nothing if a leader lacks the strength to use them.</String>
		<String _locID="67018" soundfilename="YTOKU0401">Your advanced culture is impressive. But poetry and irrigation will not help you on the field of battle.</String>
		<String _locID="67019" soundfilename="YTOKU0402">You have advanced quickly! Nothing of value ever comes from rushing. That is why I will take my time when killing you.</String>
		<String _locID="67020" soundfilename="YTOKU0403">It will take more than a tribe of listless natives to challenge Tokugawa.</String>
		<String _locID="67021" soundfilename="YTOKU0404">Those natives must see you as a worthy leader. They see Tokugawa as a god.</String>
		<String _locID="67022" soundfilename="YTOKU0405">Such a soft blow. Surely you can do better.</String>
		<String _locID="67023" soundfilename="YTOKU0406">Lucky for Tokugawa, those natives were expendable. However, it is quite unlucky for them.</String>
		<String _locID="67024" soundfilename="YTOKU0407">You may have cut off the head, but the heart of my dynasty remains.</String>
		<String _locID="67025" soundfilename="YTOKU0408">The smoke of this defeat will not cloud Tokugawa's view of victory.</String>
		<String _locID="67026" soundfilename="YTOKU0409">Take it! Stealing one trade site is like spearing one fish in a rushing river.</String>
		<String _locID="67027" soundfilename="YTOKU0410">If you seek to annoy Tokugawa then you have succeeded. You will pay for this treachery.</String>
		<String _locID="67028" soundfilename="YTOKU0411">It would be wise to advance your civilization. Its crawl is becoming somewhat pathetic.</String>
		<String _locID="67029" soundfilename="YTOKU0412">Loggers and miners will not an army make. Advance before Tokugawa grows bored with you.</String>
		<String _locID="67030" soundfilename="YTOKU0413">Your civilization advances slowly. You are well on your way to becoming a footnote in history.</String>
		<String _locID="67031" soundfilename="YTOKU0414">How can you rule such a stunted civilization? Tokugawa is surprised your people are not walking into walls.</String>
		<String _locID="67032" soundfilename="YTOKU0415">Your civilization betrays your priorities. To win a war you must focus on fighting, not advancing.</String>
		<String _locID="67033" soundfilename="YTOKU0416">If you believe that advancements will bring you victory, you are mistaken.</String>
		<String _locID="67034" soundfilename="YTOKU0417">Is is about time. We have all been waiting for you to join the civilized world.</String>
		<String _locID="67035" soundfilename="YTOKU0418">You are still advancing? Tokugawa assumed your primitive people had risen up and eaten you alive.</String>
		<String _locID="67036" soundfilename="YTOKU0419">Your ally is too far away to come to your aid. He can only watch the smoke as you burn.</String>
		<String _locID="67037" soundfilename="YTOKU0420">Tokugawa will drive a wedge between you and your allies. There is plenty of room for it.</String>
		<String _locID="67038" soundfilename="YTOKU0421">Never place your settlements too close together. You line them up for execution.</String>
		<String _locID="67039" soundfilename="YTOKU0422">Tokugawa appreciates that you have placed all of his targets in one convenient location.</String>
		<String _locID="67040" soundfilename="YTOKU0423">Remember, fool. Tokugawa is no village daimyo. He wields the power of the shogun.</String>
		<String _locID="67041" soundfilename="YTOKU0424">Once again, Tokugawa has seized the reins of fate. You cannot win.</String>
		<String _locID="67042" soundfilename="YTOKU0425">Let that be a lesson to you. Do not search for native allies in Tokugawa's lands.</String>
		<String _locID="67043" soundfilename="YTOKU0426">A fitting end to a worthless excuse for a village.</String>
		<String _locID="67044" soundfilename="YTOKU0427">Tokugawa has removed your eye sore from the beautiful horizon.</String>
		<String _locID="67045" soundfilename="YTOKU0428">Tokugawa has razed so many of your buildings that he has lost track.</String>
		<String _locID="67046" soundfilename="YTOKU0429">Remember the sting of this loss. There will be many more like it.</String>
		<String _locID="67047" soundfilename="YTOKU0430">Was that your trade site? Tokugawa torched it  just for his own amusement.</String>
		<String _locID="67048" soundfilename="YTOKU0431">Greetings. Do you realize that no one has ever defeated Tokugawa? Or had you not heard?</String>
		<String _locID="67049" soundfilename="YTOKU0432">You must be Tokugawa's opponent. Strange. I expected someone with a spark of intelligence.</String>
		<String _locID="67050" soundfilename="YTOKU0433">The mark of a true warrior is whether he can rise to a challenge. Can you?</String>
		<String _locID="67051" soundfilename="YTOKU0434">You appear more confident in your abilities. But Tokugawa knows you, and such confidence is premature.</String>
		<String _locID="67052" soundfilename="YTOKU0435">A wise warrior learns from his past mistakes. Strange. Tokugawa never expected to think of you as wise.</String>
		<String _locID="67053" soundfilename="YTOKU0436">Is Tokugawa mistaken, or did you believe yourself more capable the last time we met?</String>
		<String _locID="67054" soundfilename="YTOKU0437">We both know these lands well, but it remains to be seen how you plan to use this knowledge.</String>
		<String _locID="67055" soundfilename="YTOKU0438">Tokugawa sees no future for you. His katana will be swift, and its judgment final.</String>
		<String _locID="67056" soundfilename="YTOKU0439">You should fear this confrontation. It will be painful for you. That is a fact.</String>
		<String _locID="67057" soundfilename="YTOKU0440">Your heart should hang heavy with shame. Violence toward a monk is dishonorable.</String>
		<String _locID="67058" soundfilename="YTOKU0441">Your scouting party walks through my lands. Is there any reason I should not slay them?</String>
		<String _locID="67059" soundfilename="YTOKU0442">Tokugawa hopes this rabble is not your army. Their weakness does you no favors.</String>
		<String _locID="67060" soundfilename="YTOKU0443">Your children appear to be lost. Tokugawa shows no mercy, not even to children.</String>
		<String _locID="67061" soundfilename="YTOKU0444">Wonderful! These moving targets will provide excellent practice for Tokugawa's archers.</String>
		<String _locID="67062" soundfilename="YTOKU0445">Insects should know better than to pester the powerful, lest they be squashed.</String>
		<String _locID="67063" soundfilename="YTOKU0446">Tokugawa lets you think that your scout goes unnoticed. Think again.</String>
		<String _locID="67064" soundfilename="YTOKU0447">Call back your army. Every man, woman, and child in my dynasty will fight to the death for their master.</String>
		<String _locID="67065" soundfilename="YTOKU0448">Only cowards prey on the innocent. You shall pay for your heartlessness.</String>
		<String _locID="67066" soundfilename="YTOKU0449">The larger the army, the longer the road paved with your dead.</String>
		<String _locID="67067" soundfilename="YTOKU0450">Do your warriors know that they march into the jaws of death? No? Then Tokugawa will deliver the message.</String>
		<String _locID="67068" soundfilename="YTOKU0451">Did a litter of mangy runts wander off, or is that a group of your warriors?</String>
		<String _locID="67069" soundfilename="YTOKU0452">Come closer. You are mere moments from entering Tokugawa's trap.</String>
		<String _locID="67070" soundfilename="YTOKU0453">So you have offered sacrifices to Tokugawa. He will be sure to return their heads to you.</String>
		<String _locID="67071" soundfilename="YTOKU0454">Strangers walk our streets! You will pay for this brash action, with your life.</String>
		<String _locID="67072" soundfilename="YTOKU0455">Scavengers nibble at Tokugawa's realm. That is the only warning you will receive.</String>
		<String _locID="67073" soundfilename="YTOKU0456">Your warriors are lost. A general earns no honor in sending his men to meaningless deaths.</String>
		<String _locID="67074" soundfilename="YTOKU0457">Tokugawa has glimpsed your town center. This battle is as good as over.</String>
		<String _locID="67075" soundfilename="YTOKU0458">Your village is exposed to Tokugawa. One precise blow will end you.</String>
		<String _locID="67076" soundfilename="YTOKU0459">A predictable outcome. You should feel lucky to be alive.</String>
		<String _locID="67077" soundfilename="YTOKU0460">The righteous victor has emerged. Perhaps next time you will fare better.</String>
		<String _locID="67078" soundfilename="YTOKU0461">I hope you have not forgotten about Tokugawa. Prepare to be reminded.</String>
		<String _locID="67079" soundfilename="YTOKU0462">A shadow rolls across the horizon. A storm prepares to break. Tokugawa is coming...</String>
		<String _locID="67080" soundfilename="YTOKU0463">I detest silence. Would you mind howling with pain? Think of it as practice for what is to come.</String>
		<String _locID="67081" soundfilename="YTOKU0464">Do not allow the stillness to lull you. Much is happening, you are simply not aware of it.</String>
		<String _locID="67082" soundfilename="YTOKU0465">Since you seem to have a free moment, would you mind choosing how you would like to die: suicide or beheading?</String>
		<String _locID="67083" soundfilename="YTOKU0466">To your eyes, it appears that Tokugawa has fallen on defeat. But appearances can be deceiving.</String>
		<String _locID="67084" soundfilename="YTOKU0467">The battle worsens for Tokugawa. Care to become his ally? Name your price. Think about the future.</String>
		<String _locID="67085" soundfilename="YTOKU0468">This tactic was not part of Tokugawa's greater strategy. Your victory changes nothing.</String>
		<String _locID="67086" soundfilename="YTOKU0469">I hope these natives you seek are worth the trouble. Notice how Tokugawa shows them little interest.</String>
		<String _locID="67087" soundfilename="YTOKU0470">Your trade influence spreads quickly. But speed is a disadvantage when it moves you closer to doom.</String>
		<String _locID="67088" soundfilename="YTOKU0471">Your haste betrays your inexperience. Tokugawa values one prize only: your head.</String>
		<String _locID="67089" soundfilename="YTOKU0472">Tokugawa cares not for such treasures. They are of no help when a sword splits your skull.</String>
		<String _locID="67090" soundfilename="YTOKU0473">You snatch up treasures like a greedy child. You leave me no choice but to discipline you.</String>
		<String _locID="67091" soundfilename="YTOKU0474">Coin may be beautiful, but it will not keep your head from rolling free of your bloody shoulders.</String>
		<String _locID="67092" soundfilename="YTOKU0475">As you fill your face with food, Tokugawa keeps his eye focused on your annihilation.</String>
		<String _locID="67093" soundfilename="YTOKU0476">When Tokugawa finds you, all of that food will spill from your opened belly.</String>
		<String _locID="67094" soundfilename="YTOKU0477">Remember. The fatter you grow with treasure, the more difficult it will be to flee the onslaught.</String>
		<String _locID="67095" soundfilename="YTOKU0478">Did Tokugawa hear something? It sounds like a fly buzzing outside his walls.</String>
		<String _locID="67096" soundfilename="YTOKU0479">If you plan to steal from Tokugawa, the least you can do is cut off your fingers. It will save him the trouble.</String>
		<String _locID="67097" soundfilename="YTOKU0480">Thank you for recruiting natives. They are easier to crush under Tokugawa's feet.</String>
		<String _locID="67098" soundfilename="YTOKU0481">Every man who joins you is one more corpse to decorate the battlefield.</String>
		<String _locID="67099" soundfilename="YTOKU0482">What good are villagers? Can they swing katanas? Can they ride horses?</String>
		<String _locID="67100" soundfilename="YTOKU0483">Wood burns, you fool. I would suggest you stay away from things that go up in smoke.</String>
		<String _locID="67101" soundfilename="YTOKU0484">So, you have chosen to wall your headquarters. Tokugawa knows when he is not wanted.</String>
		<String _locID="67102" soundfilename="YTOKU0485">Do not waste your time. No wall will dam the coming flood.</String>
		<String _locID="67103" soundfilename="YTOKU0486">Tokugawa's influence expands across the countryside. The people crave a master.</String>
		<String _locID="67104" soundfilename="YTOKU0487">Tokugawa will unite the scattered peoples of this land against you.</String>
		<String _locID="67105" soundfilename="YTOKU0488">Tokugawa did not become shogun by ignoring the importance of trade.</String>
		<String _locID="67106" soundfilename="YTOKU0489">This trade site is the foundation on which Tokugawa will build a thriving economy.</String>
		<String _locID="67107" soundfilename="YTOKU0490">Do you see the wealth that awaits you? Now, come and get it. Tokugawa will be waiting.</String>
		<String _locID="67108" soundfilename="YTOKU0491">The treasures of the wilderness are Tokugawa's for the taking.</String>
		<String _locID="67109" soundfilename="YTOKU0492">Rulers deserve treasures. Servants deserve scraps.</String>
		<String _locID="67110" soundfilename="YTOKU0493">The glitter of coin will always bring Tokugawa great pleasure.</String>
		<String _locID="67111" soundfilename="YTOKU0494">Tokugawa will take this food so you do not have to. Your warriors are looking a little soft around the edges.</String>
		<String _locID="67112" soundfilename="YTOKU0495">Tokugawa consumes your crumbs, but grows hungry for the meal.</String>
		<String _locID="67113" soundfilename="YTOKU0496">Tokugawa's servants are weary from loading so many treasures. Strange. Your men look surprisingly fit.</String>
		<String _locID="67114" soundfilename="YTOKU0497">Warriors continue to fall in behind Tokugawa's banner. Can you feel the thunder of their march?</String>
		<String _locID="67115" soundfilename="YTOKU0498">A new villager is a sign that a dynasty is growing. A pity it is not your dynasty.</String>
		<String _locID="67116" soundfilename="YTOKU0499">A wise commander knows better than to waste the gifts of nature.</String>
		<String _locID="67117" soundfilename="YTOKU0500">You have captured a native settlement. Remember, haste does not make a man powerful. It only makes him sloppy.</String>
		<String _locID="67118" soundfilename="YTOKU0501">There are numerous trade sites to be had. One in many is but a snowflake in a storm.</String>
		<String _locID="67119" soundfilename="YTOKU0502">Tokugawa does not pay attention to time. His power is eternal.</String>
		<String _locID="67120" soundfilename="YTOKU0503">The countdown has started. Your remaining heartbeats are linked to the ticking of a clock.</String>
		<String _locID="67121" soundfilename="YTOKU0504">It appears you have suffered many defeats since our last meeting. What is one more?</String>
		<String _locID="67122" soundfilename="YTOKU0505">You have improved your reputation. It is surprising, considering you are such a clumsy commander.</String>
		<String _locID="67123" soundfilename="YTOKU0506">Your status impresses me. But all men, distinguished or not, bow before death.</String>
		<String _locID="67124" soundfilename="YTOKU0507">Additional experience means little when you have the strength of a child.</String>
		<String _locID="67125" soundfilename="YTOKU0508">It is agony to lift a sword, and Tokugawa's generals fall dead around him. A dynasty crumbles.</String>
		<String _locID="67126" soundfilename="YTOKU0509">This victory is especially sweet. I have learned an ally's weaknesses, which I may choose to exploit in the future. Thank you.</String>

		<String _locID="67175">This agreement has proven a good one. Where shall we set our ambitions next?</String>
		<String _locID="67176">I am counting the seconds to victory. There are so few it hardly seems worth the trouble.</String>
		<String _locID="67177">Swords and arrows break against stone. You need a bigger weapon, one that topples walls.</String>
		<String _locID="67178">Your polite tapping will not open the enemy's door. Use artillery to break it down.</String>
		<String _locID="67179">Two legs are fast, but four legs are faster. Send riders to lead your army.</String>
		<String _locID="67180">Do not saddle your men with defeat. Saddle your horses, and send them into battle.</String>
		<String _locID="67181">It may sound heartless, but more foot soldiers will take the brunt of the enemy blow.</String>
		<String _locID="67182">Infantry units are always a good addition to any army.</String>
		<String _locID="67183">Years of experience have taught me to predict a battle's outcome. Here is yours: Defeat. Retreat now.</String>
		<String _locID="67184">I would hate to lose your excellent counsel. Please cease your attack. This fight will win you only regret.</String>
		<String _locID="67185">Do you feel it? The earth shakes with the thunder of our combined armies.</String>
		<String _locID="67186">Only through cooperation can so many warriors march together. Together we are like gods.</String>
		<String _locID="67187">As expected, this fight has fallen into my hands. We should give thanks.</String>
		<String _locID="67188">With our steady alliance, such a victory was never in question.</String>
		<String _locID="67189">You have inspired me. Do you see the result, an enemy flung ragged across the landscape?</String>
		<String _locID="67190">War does not allow for much celebration, but this battle was hard won.</String>
		<String _locID="67191">An old man lives to see another day.</String>
		<String _locID="67192">Let us appreciate this victory. Next time we may not find such good fortune.</String>
		<String _locID="67193">Dawn breaks beautifully across the horizon. This is a day of victory. I can feel it.</String>
		<String _locID="67194">With your courage and my wisdom, this war will feel like a holiday.</String>
		<String _locID="67195">I pity our enemies. By taking up arms against us they have sealed their fate.</String>
		<String _locID="67196">I can see the outcome of this battle already: green fields, peace, victory.</String>
		<String _locID="67197">Your men step forward to take the blades meant for mine. Such acts are not forgotten.</String>
		<String _locID="67198">Your arrival is like the rising of the sun. Today, you have won my everlasting friendship.</String>
		<String _locID="67199">There is nothing we can do but fight our fiercest and hope for mercy.</String>
		<String _locID="67200">We may fall today, but there will be other days when the enemy is not so many.</String>
		<String _locID="67201">The proper arrangements will be made.</String>
		<String _locID="67202">If it pleases you.</String>
		<String _locID="67203">I humbly accept your request, and will see it done.</String>
		<String _locID="67204">Excellent. Your wisdom far surpasses your years.</String>
		<String _locID="67205">Siege units are my specialty. Consider it done.</String>
		<String _locID="67206">Is artillery all you require? My forges are always burning for an ally.</String>
		<String _locID="67207">There are horses to spare. I will send riders shortly.</String>
		<String _locID="67208">For another, such a request would be an inconvenience. But for you, it is nothing.</String>
		<String _locID="67209">It shall be done. Your march will be backed by the thunder of horses.</String>
		<String _locID="67210">My warriors are the finest in the world. They will bring you good fortune.</String>
		<String _locID="67211">Of course. I will send warriors as soon as I am able.</String>
		<String _locID="67212">I trust none but you with my soldiers. They are coming.</String>
		<String _locID="67213">Our stores have been depleted. There is nothing for my army, or any other.</String>
		<String _locID="67214">The war has taken its toll on my resources. There are none to spare.</String>
		<String _locID="67215">If I could gift you with a single coin, or a loaf of bread, I would. But sadly I cannot.</String>
		<String _locID="67216">Believe me, it is best if we do not.</String>
		<String _locID="67217">No. You may be wise, but you are also inexperienced.</String>
		<String _locID="67218">That would be a mistake.</String>
		<String _locID="67219">That goes against my better judgment.</String>
		<String _locID="67220">My empire has no men to send. You will need to rely on your own people this time.</String>
		<String _locID="67221">Your timing could not be worse. Every man in my army is busy at work.</String>
		<String _locID="67222">I would satisfy your needs if I could, but now is not the time.</String>
		<String _locID="67223">This is not my decision to make. Or yours.</String>
		<String _locID="67224">I am not permitted. It would bring me dishonor.</String>
		<String _locID="67225">This is not the time for such requests. There are other, more pressing matters.</String>
		<String _locID="67226">We have none left but boys and grandfathers. You will need to find warriors elsewhere.</String>
		<String _locID="67227">Many of my warriors lie dead. I cannot help you now.</String>
		<String _locID="67228">You will need to rely on your own men, not mine, to weather this brutal storm.</String>
		<String _locID="67229">The enemy adapts to our every move. We will need to be more creative in our approach.</String>
		<String _locID="67230">This is a cold and calculating blow, but we will not allow it to cool our rage.</String>
		<String _locID="67231">I have great respect for the Aztecs. They fought admirably.</String>
		<String _locID="67232">It is a shame that opponents as fierce as these Aztecs must meet such an end.</String>
		<String _locID="67233">The British empire has not lived up to its stalwart reputation. It flounders at my feet.</String>
		<String _locID="67234">The British limp towards the rear. I had expected more from them.</String>
		<String _locID="67235">The Dutch have given us good practice, but we require more resilient foes.</String>
		<String _locID="67236">With every blow, a Dutchman falls. These men are weeds, not warriors.</String>
		<String _locID="67237">I had hoped for a greater challenge from these Frenchmen, but it was simply not to be.</String>
		<String _locID="67238">Once we claim victory, there will be many French dead to bury. The land is littered with them.</String>
		<String _locID="67239">The Germans taunted themselves hoarse, only to roll over and die too easily.</String>
		<String _locID="67240">I will always find the Germans a worthy enemy. Just not a victorious one.</String>
		<String _locID="67241">All I know of these Iroquois is what today's victory has taught me. They are weaklings.</String>
		<String _locID="67242">This strange Iroquois nation has no place on the same battlefield as the Son of Heaven.</String>
		<String _locID="67243">I have faced few opponents as passionate as the Ottomans. However, passion alone does not win wars.</String>
		<String _locID="67244">The Ottomans mounted a ferocious, yet ultimately pointless, campaign.</String>
		<String _locID="67245">The end of the Portuguese grows near. Let us save our strength for the next battle.</String>
		<String _locID="67246">The decaying sons of Portugal will fertilize these lands for years to come.</String>
		<String _locID="67247">I am pleased to see these Russian soldiers fail. They have no honor, no humanity.</String>
		<String _locID="67248">It may have left our men bloodied, but the Russian onslaught is over.</String>
		<String _locID="67249">The Sioux have seen their last days. We will honor them with a quick and merciful death.</String>
		<String _locID="67250">No other army has tested me like the Sioux. Today, the world loses a fierce race.</String>
		<String _locID="67251">The Spanish are all but defeated. We have earned our rest this day.</String>
		<String _locID="67252">We have done a good thing in crushing the Spanish. If left alive, they may have conquered the world.</String>
		<String _locID="67253">The traitorous Chinese met us at every turn, swords drawn, teeth bared. This was not an easy victory.</String>
		<String _locID="67254">A primal rage runs in the blood of these traitorous Chinese. They would have made a valuable ally.</String>
		<String _locID="67255">It was foolish of the Japanese to take up arms against us. Just one of their many mistakes.</String>
		<String _locID="67256">We must thank the spirits for this triumph. The Japanese nearly had our heads on a spear.</String>
		<String _locID="67257">It is fortunate this battle is over. One more mistake and the Indians would have been the victors.</String>
		<String _locID="67258">The Indians fought a clever campaign, but they were no match for your superior strategy.</String>
		<String _locID="67259">No matter how hard we push, these Aztecs seem able to push back. Should I worry?</String>
		<String _locID="67260">These Aztecs have shown their worth. Even the Son of Heaven looks down on them with awe.</String>
		<String _locID="67261">It is no accident that the British rule a vast empire. Their reach seems to know no bounds.</String>
		<String _locID="67262">British soldiers fall all around us. Yet every time I look, there seem to be more of them.</String>
		<String _locID="67263">It is clear that the crazed Dutch have honed their skills in many bloody battles.</String>
		<String _locID="67264">I have survived impossible odds, only to see death in the eyes of the Dutch.</String>
		<String _locID="67265">The French are very strong. I find it hard to believe that they are Europeans.</String>
		<String _locID="67266">Whoever leads the French armies instills in them a fiery passion.</String>
		<String _locID="67267">The German soldiers slay our men with ease. We must fight as they do, without mercy.</String>
		<String _locID="67268">Must I rise every morning to find the Germans marching across the horizon?</String>
		<String _locID="67269">The Iroquois may finally do the impossible, and pull the Son of Heaven back to Earth.</String>
		<String _locID="67270">Every Iroquois blade finds its target. Such warriors I have never seen.</String>
		<String _locID="67271">The Ottomans continue to advance, even in the face of our deadliest warriors. These are men with no fear of death.</String>
		<String _locID="67272">Even our combined strength seems too weak to combat this Ottoman threat.</String>
		<String _locID="67273">The Portuguese warriors have no claim to humanity. They are beasts, and fight like it.</String>
		<String _locID="67274">Much to my surprise, the Portuguese are resisting their extermination.</String>
		<String _locID="67275">I see a grim flash in the Russians' eyes. They will not stop at nothing to kill us.</String>
		<String _locID="67276">I was foolish to think the Russians could be flattered into defeat. They will not back down.</String>
		<String _locID="67277">The Sioux sweep through the mountains like a terrible storm. We must seek safe cover.</String>
		<String _locID="67278">We cannot stand long against men who do not stay dead. The Sioux are fearless.</String>
		<String _locID="67279">I will never again fight the Spanish. They are too powerful.</String>
		<String _locID="67280">With every battle, my admiration for the Spanish grows. They have a gift for warfare.</String>
		<String _locID="67281">These Chinese fight like murderers, which I should have expected from such traitors.</String>
		<String _locID="67282">I should have known not to underestimate these traitorous Chinese. We may die at the hands of our own.</String>
		<String _locID="67283">The days grow colder as the Japanese samurai butcher our men like cattle.</String>
		<String _locID="67284">Japanese close in on all sides. I doubt they will listen to compromise.</String>
		<String _locID="67285">The Indians march across the countryside, leaving a bloody wake behind them.</String>
		<String _locID="67286">Entering this war, I believed the Indians to be an inferior race. I made a great mistake.</String>
		<String _locID="67287">Congratulations on your many wondrous accomplishments.</String>
		<String _locID="67288">Such advancements are not surprising. Your civilization is ahead of its time.</String>
		<String _locID="67289">We should watch our enemy carefully, or he will conquer this land one village at a time.</String>
		<String _locID="67290">We have failed the natives of this land. They deserve the protection of their emperor.</String>
		<String _locID="67291">This lack of momentum is unlike you. Please, for my sake, advance your civilization.</String>
		<String _locID="67292">We are at war, and must always strive for knowledge. Advance. Quickly!</String>
		<String _locID="67293">Follow my example, and revitalize your civilization. The time for change has come.</String>
		<String _locID="67294">You are a wise and clever leader. Now prove it, and lead your people into a new age.</String>
		<String _locID="67295">Your advancements benefit us both, my friend. I stand in awe of your accomplishments.</String>
		<String _locID="67296">Children will be told stories of the glory of your kingdom. You advance quickly.</String>
		<String _locID="67297">At last. I was worried I would need to drag your civilization behind me for the rest of the war.</String>
		<String _locID="67298">I cannot weather this storm alone. Please try to keep pace with my advancements.</String>
		<String _locID="67299">It means much to me that you honor my monks enough to save them.</String>
		<String _locID="67300">Protecting a holy man is the sign of a great commander. Thank you.</String>
		<String _locID="67301">Our watchful eye misses nothing. Every time the enemy moves, it is with our say so.</String>
		<String _locID="67302">Our enemies are foolish to believe they will find such a simple victory.</String>
		<String _locID="67303">The smoke from this village will be a warning that we should not be crossed.</String>
		<String _locID="67304">It is a pity, but those villagers should have known better than to live on a battlefield.</String>
		<String _locID="67305">We take one more step towards a resounding victory.</String>
		<String _locID="67306">The ghosts of the departed shall haunt this place for all time. We had no choice.</String>
		<String _locID="67307">If we cannot strike the enemy's heart, we will have to settle for his greedy hand.</String>
		<String _locID="67308">Trade is dear to our enemies, and anything dear to them is a target to us.</String>
		<String _locID="67309">My armies require more training. They have been repelled by savages.</String>
		<String _locID="67310">The natives have fallen for the lies of our enemy. They resist us.</String>
		<String _locID="67311">I am ashamed to admit that the enemy's settlement remains. It is a harsh reminder my of weaknesses.</String>
		<String _locID="67312">Our invasion was a crushing failure. We will regroup and try again.</String>
		<String _locID="67313">This trading post bristles with defenses.</String>
		<String _locID="67314">The traders defend their precious money with their lives. They will die before relenting.</String>
		<String _locID="67315">The gods abandon me. My monk is dead and can no longer commune with the spirits.</String>
		<String _locID="67316">Without a monk, our flow of riches will dry up. This is a dark day.</String>
		<String _locID="67317">No man deserves such a horrible death. We will give him a holy burial.</String>
		<String _locID="67318">It is right that one so in tune with nature shall be consumed by it.</String>
		<String _locID="67319">A withered heart beats beneath these bones. Old men have no place on the battlefield.</String>
		<String _locID="67320">You are quite capable. Perhaps it is time you continued on without me.</String>
		<String _locID="67321">Send your men to my aid. This war spreads like fire across the land.</String>
		<String _locID="67322">My men battle to their last breaths. Will you stand by and let this happen?</String>
		<String _locID="67323">The sun will set on my empire unless you reach it in time.</String>
		<String _locID="67324">Like flies on a corpse, the enemy buzzes over me. I need reinforcements... and quickly.</String>
		<String _locID="67325">Greetings. I have heard much about your skills in battle and mercy towards your people.</String>
		<String _locID="67326">You must be the one that the spirits foretold. I am honored to make your acquaintance.</String>
		<String _locID="67327">I have no doubt our alliance will throw its shadow across the land.</String>
		<String _locID="67328">Do not grow too confident. This challenge will be unlike those you have faced before.</String>
		<String _locID="67329">Your skills are great, but this conflict will be greater. It is a war for the ages.</String>
		<String _locID="67330">Our last meeting must have dealt your confidence a fatal blow. This will be an easy battle.</String>
		<String _locID="67331">You choose the easy path. Glory on the battlefield is won through facing a challenge, not running from it.</String>
		<String _locID="67332">We never should have fought as enemies. I always found your leadership exceptional.</String>
		<String _locID="67333">Last time we met, you mastered me. Now we stand together as equals.</String>
		<String _locID="67334">We have proved a deadly team in the past. This time, however, it is I who will lead our alliance.</String>
		<String _locID="67335">I will follow in your footsteps. Last time we fought together, you were clearly the force to be feared.</String>
		<String _locID="67336">I extend the hand of friendship to you. Please do not hold an old grudge against a new ally.</String>
		<String _locID="67337">Last time, good fortune smiled upon me, but I believe that you will dominate this campaign.</String>
		<String _locID="67338">We have a great advantage in this campaign, for every rock and every tree is familiar.</String>
		<String _locID="67339">We could have never predicted our last defeat. Let us leave it in the past, and think of the future.</String>
		<String _locID="67340">I promise you, our last adventure taught me much. An old dog can in fact learn new tricks.</String>
		<String _locID="67341">Our last battle plan proved very successful. I hope we can duplicate the results.</String>
		<String _locID="67342">In turbulent times such as these, a solid alliance is invaluable.</String>
		<String _locID="67343">Monks are men of great power. They are worth any price.</String>
		<String _locID="67344">I have paid a steep ransom for this man, but I believe he will repay his debt with action.</String>
		<String _locID="67345">This monk has given his life for our cause. The least we can do is give some coin for his.</String>
		<String _locID="67346">I have rescued a monk from the hands of our enemies. They will pay for their cruelty.</String>
		<String _locID="67347">My monk will never be the same man he was, but he lives to see another day.</String>
		<String _locID="67348">It is a joyous day when one of our own is brought home safely.</String>
		<String _locID="67349">A general must always lead with caution, but such an opportunity is a rare thing.</String>
		<String _locID="67350">Put your warriors on alert. The enemy does not know what awaits them.</String>
		<String _locID="67351">Do you see it? An enemy town lies undefended, like a tiger with its teeth pulled out.</String>
		<String _locID="67352">There is no soldier in sight. We must attack.</String>
		<String _locID="67353">This town will react slowly without riders to protect it. Our cavalry will trample them into the dirt.</String>
		<String _locID="67354">A town without a stable is a town without hope. We should take advantage.</String>
		<String _locID="67355">I am always willing to share my wealth with a friend.</String>
		<String _locID="67356">How you spend this coin is none of my concern. I ask no questions.</String>
		<String _locID="67357">Take this. There is always more coin here if you need it.</String>
		<String _locID="67358">My men will halve their rations so yours may eat.</String>
		<String _locID="67359">We fight for the same cause. Therefore we should share the same bread.</String>
		<String _locID="67360">Take this gift of wood. I am sure you would do the same for me.</String>
		<String _locID="67361">How can my ally build without the proper resources? Please, take this wood.</String>
		<String _locID="67362">It is time to march on the enemy settlement.</String>
		<String _locID="67363">I wish to end this war before it can grow bloodier. Watch over me as I journey into battle.</String>
		<String _locID="67364">To kill a weed, you must remove its roots. To kill a ruler, you must remove his villagers.</String>
		<String _locID="67365">A master's greatest assets are his servants. Without villagers, our enemy will flounder.</String>
		<String _locID="67366">Every fallen villager weakens our enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="67367">All of the conditions are right for a massive assault. The Son of Heaven has his eye on the enemy stronghold.</String>
		<String _locID="67368">I march towards what I hope will be the final battle. If I do not return, remember me fondly.</String>
		<String _locID="67369">Our attack has begun. The enemy will rest peaceful this night. They will sleep the sleep of the dead.</String>
		<String _locID="67370">The natives do not know they are pawns. We will have to win them to our side by force.</String>
		<String _locID="67371">Every village we claim is one fewer rock for the enemy to hide under.</String>
		<String _locID="67372">My men move to snatch a trading post from the enemy's grasp.</String>
		<String _locID="67373">Before this day is over, a trading post will burn to the ground.</String>
		<String _locID="67374">You no longer need to peer over your shoulder, my warriors make haste to your position.</String>
		<String _locID="67375">Allies fight together, not alone.</String>
		<String _locID="67376">Hold your ground for a few moments more. The Son of Heaven closes the distance between us.</String>
		<String _locID="67377">This spot looks fertile for a growing army.</String>
		<String _locID="67378">Many a warrior will find his purpose here, where I break this ground.</String>
		<String _locID="67379">With this building, I claim this land for the Son of Heaven.</String>
		<String _locID="67380">This shall be the beating heart of a new Chinese empire.</String>
		<String _locID="67381">On this piece of dirt, an empire is born. You will always be welcome here, ally.</String>
		<String _locID="67382">It is a pity we must wage war. This town center seems to sit in paradise itself.</String>
		<String _locID="67383">Every village that does not submit to me could submit to my enemy. I must prevent this.</String>
		<String _locID="67384">This native village will wake to find itself subject to a new ruler.</String>
		<String _locID="67385">Claiming this village will bring us one step closer to victory.</String>
		<String _locID="67386">This trade site belongs to the Son of Heaven.</String>
		<String _locID="67387">The sooner we establish trade dominance, the harder it will be for our enemy to resist our influence.</String>
		<String _locID="67388">My men will not be forced from this building. They will come out only as corpses.</String>
		<String _locID="67389">I will not abandon my people. We will defend this building at all costs.</String>
		<String _locID="67390">This piece of land is dear to us. If my men fall here, it will be their last act.</String>
		<String _locID="67391">Stay alert. My warriors will defend this patch of land, but may need your aid.</String>
		<String _locID="67392">It is right for a ruler to defend those in his domain. I will defend this village to the death.</String>
		<String _locID="67393">You will not win the respect of your subjects with weakness. This village must be defended.</String>
		<String _locID="67394">It may be unwise, but I will not give up this town. An emperor rules by example.</String>
		<String _locID="67395">Subjects of the Qing Dynasty will fight back against any invader.</String>
		<String _locID="67396">This trade site will be defended, against all odds.</String>
		<String _locID="67397">We have fought bravely for this trade site. It will not fall easily into the hands of our enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="67398">A steady trickle of wealth is yours for the spending.</String>
		<String _locID="67399">Whenever you have the need for coin, I will satisfy it.</String>
		<String _locID="67400">As an emperor, I am a provider. Your people will never want for food.</String>
		<String _locID="67401">I have no shortage of wood in my empire. Take what you need, and save the rest for later.</String>
		<String _locID="67402">I have never abandoned an ally. My men rush to your aid, I only hope they reach you in time.</String>
		<String _locID="67403">I feel every one of your wounds. I am coming. Hold on for as long as you can.</String>
		<String _locID="67404">The enemy will see an example of true solidarity. I have sent warriors to join you.</String>
		<String _locID="67405">Is there anything I can do for you as we prepare for our next attack?</String>
		<String _locID="67406">I would like once again to express my gratitude for your friendship. It has served my people quite well.</String>
		<String _locID="67407">As one ruler to another, could I ask for a loan of coin?</String>
		<String _locID="67408">It pains me to ask, but can you spare some coin for a fading emperor?</String>
		<String _locID="67409">It has been a lean time in my empire. My people look to you for nourishment.</String>
		<String _locID="67410">My friend, a small gift of wood is needed. Can you oblige?</String>
		<String _locID="67411">Could an ally spare several logs from his fire? My villages need wood.</String>
		<String _locID="67412">I will never forget this heroic act. Your men will go down as legends in my empire.</String>
		<String _locID="67413">So it is true. Together, we can overcome any obstacle.</String>
		<String _locID="67414">You have once again earned my trust. Thank you for joining me.</String>
		<String _locID="67415">My advisors were beginning to worry. The coin is appreciated.</String>
		<String _locID="67416">Even an emperor can use additional coin. Many thanks.</String>
		<String _locID="67417">I have never been unable to provide for my people. This food helps.</String>
		<String _locID="67418">We are at war. Starvation should not be claiming our people. Thank you.</String>
		<String _locID="67419">You are more than an ally, you are a friend. Your act has saved my people.</String>
		<String _locID="67420">This is a moment when I have few words. Thank you. I thought my empire was surely doomed.</String>
		<String _locID="67421">Your warriors will always have a home in this town they have defended.</String>
		<String _locID="67422">I realize how much these resources mean to you. They will not be wasted.</String>
		<String _locID="67423">Thank you. These come just in time.</String>
		<String _locID="67424">Your donation of wood could not have come at a better time.</String>
		<String _locID="67425">An old man often forgets the essentials. Thank you for the wood.</String>
		<String _locID="67426">The Aztecs tighten their grip on our throats. Soon we will be unable to breathe.</String>
		<String _locID="67427">Our armies stumble in their efforts, weakened by the superior Aztec enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="67428">The British have beaten our men bloody. Is there any way for us to recover?</String>
		<String _locID="67429">I knew the British were strong, but not this strong.</String>
		<String _locID="67430">Losing to the Dutch would be a disaster, yet I cannot find their weakness.</String>
		<String _locID="67431">This old man cannot stomach one more defeat, whether its the Dutch or anyone else.</String>
		<String _locID="67432">Our weak defense betrays us. Even if we survive, the French will be as strong as ever.</String>
		<String _locID="67433">The French do not even notice our resistance, as if we were insects to be ignored.</String>
		<String _locID="67434">Germans stampede across the landscape. I am getting too old for this.</String>
		<String _locID="67435">I have seen much in my time, but never an enemy as terrifying as the Germans.</String>
		<String _locID="67436">I thought our alliance supreme, but the Iroquois shatter it with one blow.</String>
		<String _locID="67437">Even if we live to see another day, the Iroquois will be there to greet us when we wake.</String>
		<String _locID="67438">Killing is a sport to these Ottomans. I have nothing left to offer them but my death.</String>
		<String _locID="67439">Is this the death of our empire? I only hope we showed these Ottomans the meaning of honor.</String>
		<String _locID="67440">They may crush us easily, but I will never, ever submit to the Portuguese.</String>
		<String _locID="67441">My fortunes never suggested such abuse at the hands of the Portuguese.</String>
		<String _locID="67442">Every time a warrior falls, I expect the Russian assault to cease. But it never does.</String>
		<String _locID="67443">The Russians thrive on our anguish. There is no diplomacy when you deal with animals.</String>
		<String _locID="67444">The number of Sioux never seems to diminish. Our arrows fall into a bottomless pit.</String>
		<String _locID="67445">There is only one word for this war against the Sioux, and that is suicide.</String>
		<String _locID="67446">I am at a loss for ideas, my friend. The Spanish test us in ways I never imagined.</String>
		<String _locID="67447">This is no longer a battlefield. Thanks to the Spanish, it has become a graveyard.</String>
		<String _locID="67448">I fear that these traitorous Chinese will defeat the very emperor that they betrayed: Me.</String>
		<String _locID="67449">I am ashamed to admit that the Chinese traitors mistreat us. They have made a fool of me.</String>
		<String _locID="67450">Where is our honor? Where is our courage? Our warriors retreat from the Japanese.</String>
		<String _locID="67451">When a Japanese warrior falls it is only after killing five our men. We must do something.</String>
		<String _locID="67452">The Indians have marched back with renewed strength.</String>
		<String _locID="67453">I look into the future and see an Indian dawn. Unless we act now, our time is over.</String>
		<String _locID="67454">We must survive long enough to strike back with a ferocity the Aztecs have never seen.</String>
		<String _locID="67455">The British have wasted their greatest warriors in gaining the advantage. Now it is our turn.</String>
		<String _locID="67456">The Dutch fight back fiercely, but they cannot do so for long.</String>
		<String _locID="67457">The French pour their strongest into this offensive, but leave little reserves to continue.</String>
		<String _locID="67458">Even as we feel the tips of their blades, they weaken. The Germans will not last.</String>
		<String _locID="67459">Our men may die, but the Iroquois weaken. Soon we will have our revenge.</String>
		<String _locID="67460">Ottomans think not of the future. They may weaken us, but our vengeance will be final.</String>
		<String _locID="67461">It is wrong of the Portuguese to show such cruelty, especially when they are so weak.</String>
		<String _locID="67462">We will lie in wait, taking the Russians' damage, but preparing for retaliation.</String>
		<String _locID="67463">The Sioux carelessly throw their resources into this attack, tiring themselves in the process.</String>
		<String _locID="67464">Every blow costs the Spanish morale and energy. When they are depleted, we strike.</String>
		<String _locID="67465">All we have to do is stay alive long enough to slaughter the traitorous Chinese.</String>
		<String _locID="67466">Once we pull out of harm's way, we will strike, and finish these Japanese for good.</String>
		<String _locID="67467">We may be losing, but the Indians have little left to give. One more attack will be their undoing.</String>
		<String _locID="67468">It is up to you to lead us to victory, my friend. The sun has set on the Qing Dynasty.</String>
		<String _locID="67469">One more time I come to you on my knees, ally. Pull this battle from the flames of defeat.</String>
		<String _locID="67470">I will not give up until the enemy is vanquished and you have been returned to your former glory.</String>
		<String _locID="67471">We may weaken, but I still have the strength to bring this battle to the enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="67472">They are wilting. We must stoke the fire and increase the heat.</String>
		<String _locID="67473">We must keep up this pace, striking the enemy while we have them cornered.</String>
		<String _locID="67474">The enemy falls, the war comes to a close, and the student becomes the master.</String>
		<String _locID="67475">The enemy dries up like a husk. You have taken my teachings and improved upon them.</String>
		<String _locID="67476">It is normal to fear, even in the face of certain victory. I will watch over you, like a grandfather to a child.</String>
		<String _locID="67477">The battle goes well, but the war is far from over. I will get us through this deadly storm.</String>
		<String _locID="67478">Every old man learns to live with death. Yet I did not expect it so soon.</String>
		<String _locID="67479">I do not know if I have the energy for such a campaign. Our enemy is simply too strong.</String>
		<String _locID="67480">All this death has left me weary. These old bones break under the weight of our enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="67481">Shadows of defeat darken our futures. Enjoy the sunset. It may be our last.</String>
		<String _locID="67482">I have ordered my men to begin digging. The tomb of an emperor takes time, and there is little of it left.</String>
		<String _locID="67483">Our partnership has been one of legendary courage. Perhaps we shall meet again in the next life.</String>
		<String _locID="67484">The enemy wishes to end this campaign quickly, but we must resist.</String>
		<String _locID="67485">Little does the enemy know that their bid for victory will lead only to defeat. Now is the time to strike.</String>
		<String _locID="67486">The enemy claims more native lands.  We must hurry, a ruler is nothing without subjects.</String>
		<String _locID="67487">I must admit, the enemy has charisma. The natives rally behind them.</String>
		<String _locID="67488">Our enemy has laid the foundation for a trade empire, but we cannot lose hope.</String>
		<String _locID="67489">That trade site should have been ours. What is an alliance if we do not work together?</String>
		<String _locID="67490">We watch helplessly as the people of this land fall in behind the enemy banner. It is a grim omen.</String>
		<String _locID="67491">This cannot continue. The native people turn against us in droves.</String>
		<String _locID="67492">A wise commander would have seen this coming. Our opponents will use their vast trade to break us.</String>
		<String _locID="67493">Our strong start has slowed to a crawl. The enemy flaunts its trade empire in our faces.</String>
		<String _locID="67494">You strike like lightning! The enemy will regret not seeking your allegiance.</String>
		<String _locID="67495">Natives can be  the key to victory or defeat. You will not regret this act.</String>
		<String _locID="67496">Yours is a remarkable achievement. I am proud to call you my ally.</String>
		<String _locID="67497">It seems you have an eye for commerce, as well as an eye for war.</String>
		<String _locID="67498">Such a treasure will aid us both, my friend.</String>
		<String _locID="67499">In war, resources are as important as weapons.</String>
		<String _locID="67500">You have a keen eye for treasure.  This is good, as every contribution counts.</String>
		<String _locID="67501">It is wise to keep the supply line flowing swiftly.</String>
		<String _locID="67502">The sweet chime of coin is music to the ears of any man.</String>
		<String _locID="67503">Greed is not greed when it benefits a righteous cause such as ours.</String>
		<String _locID="67504">Warriors deserve the finest food, especially if for some it is their last meal.</String>
		<String _locID="67505">Do not allow your men to grow too plump in their feasting.</String>
		<String _locID="67506">It is a good thing we are allies, otherwise there would be no treasures left for me to discover.</String>
		<String _locID="67507">Never have I met a commander with a such a taste for treasure. You put me to shame.</String>
		<String _locID="67508">I will allow you to take what is mine this once but please look elsewhere in the future.</String>
		<String _locID="67509">Do you wish to offend me, my friend? Save some riches for the rest of us.</String>
		<String _locID="67510">It delights me to see a fresh warrior for our cause.</String>
		<String _locID="67511">You summon warriors to you. The powerful recognize one of their own.</String>
		<String _locID="67512">More subjects join you. Remember. How you treat your servants is how you treat your empire.</String>
		<String _locID="67513">Every man who sees you in battle wishes to pledge you his allegiance.</String>
		<String _locID="67514">Use this precious resource with care. Trees grow scarce rapidly.</String>
		<String _locID="67515">In the heat of battle, your archers will thank you for this wood.</String>
		<String _locID="67516">Our empire stretches in every direction, a product of your cunning strategies.</String>
		<String _locID="67517">You have shown that despite the enemy's strength, the people of this land are on our side.</String>
		<String _locID="67518">A sly move, my friend. You have put us in a very advantageous position.</String>
		<String _locID="67519">I see now that your steady pace has all been part of a larger plot. Well done.</String>
		<String _locID="67520">A wall is only effective when paired with an aggressive strategy.</String>
		<String _locID="67521">You make a wise choice. An enemy can only harm those within his reach.</String>
		<String _locID="67522">I have learned that natives must be bought with gifts and protection. I have made the first move.</String>
		<String _locID="67523">One can only win over the people of his empire if he holds out a hand in peace.</String>
		<String _locID="67524">As usual, I have chosen to set an example. This trade site will contribute much to our alliance.</String>
		<String _locID="67525">The land will always provide for the Son of Heaven.</String>
		<String _locID="67526">I gather riches easily, like a child at play.</String>
		<String _locID="67527">The glint of gold has given me hope for this campaign.</String>
		<String _locID="67528">The battle will rage on, thanks to the addition of coin to my coffers.</String>
		<String _locID="67529">My men will rejoice at this discovery of food.</String>
		<String _locID="67530">I only collect these riches because we are allies. Normally, I would have left them to you.</String>
		<String _locID="67531">This treasure lies close to your headquarters. I will share it, if you so desire.</String>
		<String _locID="67532">You are a steadfast warrior but a terrible treasure hunter. How do you expect to fund this war?</String>
		<String _locID="67533">I have tried to stay silent, but one emperor cannot support two empires. Search for treasure.</String>
		<String _locID="67534">I have come upon warriors willing to fight beside our men.</String>
		<String _locID="67535">These warriors have seen much bloodshed and will make a fine addition to our army.</String>
		<String _locID="67536">These villagers are the foundation of our army. Every last one of them is an asset.</String>
		<String _locID="67537">This is good. Strong villagers are needed to help our empire grow beyond its borders.</String>
		<String _locID="67538">Wood serves us better tucked in quivers than lying on the forest floor.</String>
		<String _locID="67539">Any veteran commander will tell you, wood fuels the fire of victory.</String>
		<String _locID="67540">More natives hurry to join us.</String>
		<String _locID="67541">Ambition has its rewards. Our empire grows, surpassing the blight of our enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="67542">One more trade site has fallen under our influence, putting us in the lead.</String>
		<String _locID="67543">I would like to see our enemies reach me now.</String>
		<String _locID="67544">Even with these impassable barriers, my gates are always open to you.</String>
		<String _locID="67545">Victory is within sight, but the enemy slithers in the grass, waiting for a time to strike.</String>
		<String _locID="67546">We have worked hard for this fortunate position. I only hope we can maintain it.</String>
		<String _locID="67547">Forget past tragedies and focus on the battle ahead. It is an opportunity to reclaim lost glory.</String>
		<String _locID="67548">You have ventured into the world and found defeat. Do not worry, for every failure teaches us a lesson.</String>
		<String _locID="67549">You return to me a seasoned warrior, with the blood of many victories on your hands.</String>
		<String _locID="67550">Fresh scars mark you, my friend. Your enemies did not stand a chance.</String>
		<String _locID="67551">I look forward to benefiting from your experience. Together we will prove unstoppable.</String>
		<String _locID="67552">Much has changed since our last encounter. You have grown into a masterful commander.</String>
		<String _locID="67553">I fought my hardest, but in the end the better warrior won the day.</String>
		<String _locID="67554">It has been an honor knowing you, but it appears my time on this Earth is finished.</String>
		<String _locID="67555">You have only seconds left. Enjoy them.</String>
		<String _locID="67556">Take one last look at the beauty surrounding you. Your end is near.</String>
		<String _locID="67557">So many men, so much death. Come morning, many mothers will weep for their lost sons.</String>
		<String _locID="67558">It is as if the spirits themselves fight for our fates. I have never witnessed such a conflict.</String>
		<String _locID="67559">No ruler wins the greater war without losing one or two of the smaller battles.</String>
		<String _locID="67560">Next time, I will be better prepared. You learn quickly. It is duly noted.</String>
		<String _locID="67561">Some battles do not end as you expected. To dwell on defeat is a fool's game.</String>
		<String _locID="67562">It appears that this day belongs to me. Do not lose faith. Tomorrow is another day.</String>
		<String _locID="67563">I hope you learn something from this defeat and improve your skills for our next meeting.</String>
		<String _locID="67564">The predator always devours its prey. It is the law of nature.</String>
		<String _locID="67565">With your passion for victory and my long history of it, this will be a battle for the ages.</String>
		<String _locID="67566">Stories of your exploits are well known to me. You have my respect and my admiration.</String>
		<String _locID="67567">My allies' men fight for me as they would for their own commanders. This is true allegiance.</String>
		<String _locID="67568">Do you see? My ally is loyal even as the blood flows. Can you say the same of your allies?</String>
		<String _locID="67569">This battle turns, but without the aid of your ally you would have been mine. Remember that.</String>
		<String _locID="67570">There must be something about you that I do not see. Your ally rushes to your aid like a man possessed.</String>
		<String _locID="67571">Your advancement means little to me. I have more important things to do than gaze upon your every development.</String>
		<String _locID="67572">An empire that advances hastily very rarely stands the test of time. Such is my philosophy.</String>
		<String _locID="67573">Patience is the sign of a lasting ruler. I will advance when it serves my purpose.</String>
		<String _locID="67574">Your seizure of this village does not bother me. If I had wanted it, I would have taken it.</String>
		<String _locID="67575">Those poor natives. They do not understand to whom they have pledged their loyalty.</String>
		<String _locID="67576">The blood of those innocents is on your hands. Murder is a tool of the weak.</String>
		<String _locID="67577">You can kill those who serve me, but you will never kill their devotion.</String>
		<String _locID="67578">My headquarters may fall into shadow, but the sun has not yet set on my empire.</String>
		<String _locID="67579">This is not a final blow against my army. No. It is simply one more excuse to destroy you.</String>
		<String _locID="67580">Congratulations. But cutting down one tree will not remove the forest.</String>
		<String _locID="67581">I will not worry. When one trade site falls, another takes its place.</String>
		<String _locID="67582">I do not wish to lay waste to your empire without a fight. Please advance, and make yourself a more worthy opponent.</String>
		<String _locID="67583">Your villagers outnumber your soldiers three to one. Are you building an army or a pig farm?</String>
		<String _locID="67584">Have I disrupted your plans so much as to keep you from advancing?</String>
		<String _locID="67585">This behavior is not in keeping with your wisdom. Why does your civilization languish?</String>
		<String _locID="67586">Such a beautiful civilization. It is a shame I will soon leave it in ruins.</String>
		<String _locID="67587">You deserve all praise given. Your civilization is indeed magnificent.</String>
		<String _locID="67588">My subjects have been asking the gods for your advancement. They felt guilty fighting such a shiftless people.</String>
		<String _locID="67589">Welcome to this age of wonder. Unfortunately, we cannot share our discoveries with you.</String>
		<String _locID="67590">You try to surround me with your towns. But remember. Scattered towns are weakened towns.</String>
		<String _locID="67591">Your dying shouts will not be heard, for your friends are too far away.</String>
		<String _locID="67592">It is too easy. I could crush all of you at once, like a line of ants beneath my foot.</String>
		<String _locID="67593">A single blow could wipe your kind from the map. You and your allies might wish to relocate.</String>
		<String _locID="67594">Your victory rises to the sky as smoke. You do not have the might to win this fight.</String>
		<String _locID="67595">A dog that bites his master must be reminded of his place. Do not try to win that way again.</String>
		<String _locID="67596">I deplore such acts of destruction, but I have no choice other than to destroy this site.</String>
		<String _locID="67597">These natives have paid the price for their misguided allegiance.</String>
		<String _locID="67598">From this point on, the battle turns for the Son of Heaven. It is over.</String>
		<String _locID="67599">As this town center collapses, so do your dreams of glory.</String>
		<String _locID="67600">What a pity. That trade site could have aided my army.</String>
		<String _locID="67601">You practically begged for me to destroy that site. I hope you have learned a lesson.</String>
		<String _locID="67602">You look well. Let us hope something good comes from this unfortunate conflict.</String>
		<String _locID="67603">If there is a way to avoid this barbaric affair, please tell me now. I detest unnecessary death.</String>
		<String _locID="67604">You have grown bolder and braver since our last encounter. It does not go unnoticed.</String>
		<String _locID="67605">Is this a joke? Do you truly wish to face such steep and bloody challenges?</String>
		<String _locID="67606">Our last engagement must have tormented you. This lack of confidence is not in your character.</String>
		<String _locID="67607">A warrior never fights with half his heart, and no battle is easier than the last.</String>
		<String _locID="67608">I have not been able to rid my mind of this setting. Too many of my men have died here.</String>
		<String _locID="67609">There is no such thing as an easy battle. Despite the odds, you will suffer greatly before defeat.</String>
		<String _locID="67610">Be warned, you will face many obstacles on the path to victory. More than you are used to.</String>
		<String _locID="67611">Once again, my monk is safe. That was no way to treat a man of peace.</String>
		<String _locID="67612">Your men tour my dominion. Surrender now and they will not be harmed.</String>
		<String _locID="67613">I have your warriors in sight.  Please, this is your last chance to give up and claim defeat.</String>
		<String _locID="67614">I see warriors in the distance. They make an easy target for my archers.</String>
		<String _locID="67615">Any man can field an army, but it takes a leader to wield it. Which one are you?</String>
		<String _locID="67616">I see our respect is not mutual. Why have you sent men to my town?</String>
		<String _locID="67617">Your warriors flirt with disaster. Call them back before it is too late.</String>
		<String _locID="67618">What a heinous act. I expected more from you than this brand of cowardice.</String>
		<String _locID="67619">It is mercy, not murder, that makes a ruler great.</String>
		<String _locID="67620">That shaking is not the earth but the army marching over it. You should be feared.</String>
		<String _locID="67621">I hope you do not plan to use your army for an attack. There must another solution.</String>
		<String _locID="67622">I had hoped to find friendly faces in my territory, not the harsh gazes of warriors.</String>
		<String _locID="67623">Please, disband your army before I do it for you.</String>
		<String _locID="67624">There is no honor in striking a man at home, burning his farms, killing his families.</String>
		<String _locID="67625">You have wandered too far from your own domain. Turn back now or face the consequences.</String>
		<String _locID="67626">I hope this tiny band is not representative of your military might.</String>
		<String _locID="67627">My empire is not a public garden. Have your men stroll elsewhere.</String>
		<String _locID="67628">I stare into the exposed heart of your empire.</String>
		<String _locID="67629">I have found you. Now we can begin the negotiations for your surrender.</String>
		<String _locID="67630">This has been a fierce competition, but the victor was never in doubt.</String>
		<String _locID="67631">I am impressed with your tenacity, but the victory is still mine.</String>
		<String _locID="67632">This chapter in our relationship must end. Draw your sword, the time has come.</String>
		<String _locID="67633">That is not thunder, my friend. That is the sound of marching feet, the sound of your destruction.</String>
		<String _locID="67634">I can only imagine the strategies you must be devising.</String>
		<String _locID="67635">Do not be offended by my silence. I am simply looking after the needs of my people.</String>
		<String _locID="67636">Will you not reconsider this foolish war? My warriors crave your blood.</String>
		<String _locID="67637">There is no place left for this old warrior. I must admit defeat in the eyes of my enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="67638">I will not allow my people to suffer any longer. Will you accept my surrender?</String>
		<String _locID="67639">I should be outraged by this act, but I would have done the same thing myself.</String>
		<String _locID="67640">You rush to make this land your own, but I believe its natives will have an opinion on this matter.</String>
		<String _locID="67641">Many factors contribute to victory. Your number of trade sites impresses, but ultimately means nothing.</String>
		<String _locID="67642">I see you have won the race for resources. Everything in battle is a race.</String>
		<String _locID="67643">You should set your sights on the battlefield and not on scattered treasures.</String>
		<String _locID="67644">You have worked hard to hoard these riches. I hope you can hold onto them.</String>
		<String _locID="67645">Gold, not steel, is the weapon of war. You are smart to seek it.</String>
		<String _locID="67646">Enjoy the food. Your men have fought bravely, and earned it.</String>
		<String _locID="67647">A great man provides for those in need. Your people will be thankful for the food.</String>
		<String _locID="67648">I could learn much from such an aggressive gatherer.</String>
		<String _locID="67649">Do not venture too close, my friend. It is best not to poke a sleeping tiger.</String>
		<String _locID="67650">Strong rulers obtain their own treasures. They do not steal them from another.</String>

		<String _locID="67862" soundfilename="YAKBA0150">The enemy put up a passionate fight. I may require reinforcements.</String>
		<String _locID="67863" soundfilename="YAKBA0151">The enemy seeks to defy the gods and overrun my town. Help us. Help us now!</String>
		<String _locID="67864" soundfilename="YAKBA0152">Everywhere I turn, I see strange faces. My empire burns. I plead for your help, ally.</String>
		<String _locID="67865" soundfilename="YAKBA0153">I look forward to the wonderful things we will do as allies, if the gods will it.</String>
		<String _locID="67866" soundfilename="YAKBA0154">The heavens open up to bless our alliance. We will do great things together.</String>
		<String _locID="67867" soundfilename="YAKBA0155">My heart warms like the sun to see your face. Welcome.</String>
		<String _locID="67868" soundfilename="YAKBA0156">Much has changed since our last battle. You have chosen a more difficult path. I respect that.</String>
		<String _locID="67869" soundfilename="YAKBA0157">I like this confidence. You should seek to face more difficult challenges. Know no fear when the gods are on your side.</String>
		<String _locID="67870" soundfilename="YAKBA0158">I do not understand the need to set your sights so low. Together with the Mughal, you will find the victory you seek.</String>
		<String _locID="67871" soundfilename="YAKBA0159">You underestimate yourself by choosing this battle, my ally. With the divine supporting us, we could stare down any adversary.</String>
		<String _locID="67872" soundfilename="YAKBA0160">When last we fought, I secretly admired your prowess. Now having you as an ally, I have been blessed with it.</String>
		<String _locID="67873" soundfilename="YAKBA0161">I remember you. We were enemies once, but the past must be put behind us now.</String>
		<String _locID="67874" soundfilename="YAKBA0162">Last time you proved an incredible force on the battlefield. Like me, you are one of the chosen ones.</String>
		<String _locID="67875" soundfilename="YAKBA0163">I have been meditating on our last alliance. I hope to acquire some of the lessons that led you to such dominance.</String>
		<String _locID="67876" soundfilename="YAKBA0164">It appears you have returned educated from our last ecounter. I hope you put harsh lessons to good use.</String>
		<String _locID="67877" soundfilename="YAKBA0165">It is not important that I dominated our last alliance. The gods have given you a new opportunity for glory.</String>
		<String _locID="67878" soundfilename="YAKBA0166">We have been blessed with a great advantage. If I am not mistaken, we have fought on these lands before.</String>
		<String _locID="67879" soundfilename="YAKBA0167">The gods grant all of us second chances. That is why life is long.</String>
		<String _locID="67880" soundfilename="YAKBA0168">Do not worry. Our past failures will serve to remind us of what is at stake in these battles.</String>
		<String _locID="67881" soundfilename="YAKBA0169">My ally, I am pleased to see you again. It is clear we are destined for greatness.</String>
		<String _locID="67882" soundfilename="YAKBA0170">The gods are good. Once again they have blessed me with your presence.</String>
		<String _locID="67883" soundfilename="YAKBA0171">I would have paid any price for the safe return of my Brahmin.</String>
		<String _locID="67884" soundfilename="YAKBA0172">There is no substitute for the life of a holy man. Brahmin are priceless to me.</String>
		<String _locID="67885" soundfilename="YAKBA0173">I had to pay for the return of my Brahmin, but it was money well spent.</String>
		<String _locID="67886" soundfilename="YAKBA0174">The rescue of my Brahmin is proof of the enemy's weakness.</String>
		<String _locID="67887" soundfilename="YAKBA0175">I have saved my Brahmin. He reveals to me many secrets of the enemy's lair.</String>
		<String _locID="67888" soundfilename="YAKBA0176">My Brahmin are dear to me. Their mistreatment begs the wrath of the gods.</String>
		<String _locID="67889" soundfilename="YAKBA0177">A town center stands before me, naked. Not a single soldier waits to defend it.</String>
		<String _locID="67890" soundfilename="YAKBA0178">The gods have blessed me with knowledge. I see the enemy, and he has no army.</String>
		<String _locID="67891" soundfilename="YAKBA0179">Give thanks to the heavens. A vision reveals to me the enemy's lack of barracks.</String>
		<String _locID="67892" soundfilename="YAKBA0180">Nothing can be hidden from the gods. They have shown me the enemy town, and there is no barracks.</String>
		<String _locID="67893" soundfilename="YAKBA0181">I see clearly the enemy's mistakes. A town without a stable is a town that can be conquered.</String>
		<String _locID="67894" soundfilename="YAKBA0182">Divine sight grants me witness to the enemy town center. No stable stands there.</String>
		<String _locID="67895" soundfilename="YAKBA0183">Take this as a sign of my good faith.</String>
		<String _locID="67896" soundfilename="YAKBA0184">You have been good to me. This shows my appreciation.</String>
		<String _locID="67897" soundfilename="YAKBA0185">Please, find use for this gold. It is yours.</String>
		<String _locID="67898" soundfilename="YAKBA0186">It may come from my hand, but this food is a gift from the gods.</String>
		<String _locID="67899" soundfilename="YAKBA0187">Feed your hungry men with this.</String>
		<String _locID="67900" soundfilename="YAKBA0188">We use what nature provides, but sometimes you must rely on your friends. Take this wood.</String>
		<String _locID="67901" soundfilename="YAKBA0189">I have no doubt you will find a good place for this wood.</String>
		<String _locID="67902" soundfilename="YAKBA0190">The gods send me to strike the enemy headquarters. Tell me, how can an empire survive without its beating heart?</String>
		<String _locID="67903" soundfilename="YAKBA0191">As the sun rises, I glimpse my future. Through smoke and fire, I see the enemy base burning.</String>
		<String _locID="67904" soundfilename="YAKBA0192">I am not proud of my decision, but it needed to be made. I have launched a raid on enemy villagers.</String>
		<String _locID="67905" soundfilename="YAKBA0193">A nation is only as strong as its weakest citizen.  I have ordered my men to strike the enemy's villagers.</String>
		<String _locID="67906" soundfilename="YAKBA0194">It chills my blood to do it, but I must go and cut down the enemy's gatherers.</String>
		<String _locID="67907" soundfilename="YAKBA0195">Our partnership has been a good one, but my faith is my own. I march towards the enemy capital.</String>
		<String _locID="67908" soundfilename="YAKBA0196">I order my armies on the enemy town. If I do not return, my empire lies in your hands.</String>
		<String _locID="67909" soundfilename="YAKBA0197">The time has come. The prophecies ring true. The gods send me forth to glory in the enemy capital.</String>
		<String _locID="67910" soundfilename="YAKBA0198">Every enemy settlement is a settlement we cannot leave standing.</String>
		<String _locID="67911" soundfilename="YAKBA0199">The converts of the enemy must learn the consequences of their choice. We will destroy this native village.</String>
		<String _locID="67912" soundfilename="YAKBA0200">We must wipe that trading post from the map. It is an affront to our cause.</String>
		<String _locID="67913" soundfilename="YAKBA0201">This trade site stands as a blemish on Mughal land. It cannot remain.</String>
		<String _locID="67914" soundfilename="YAKBA0202">The army of the Mughal marches to open a second front. It is our destiny.</String>
		<String _locID="67915" soundfilename="YAKBA0203">I have been given a sign to aid you in this endeavor. We will drive the enemy into a panic.</String>
		<String _locID="67916" soundfilename="YAKBA0204">My soldiers move in for the kill. Sometimes tolerance must give way to force.</String>
		<String _locID="67917" soundfilename="YAKBA0205">On this spot I will build the finest army the world has ever seen. It is the will of the gods.</String>
		<String _locID="67918" soundfilename="YAKBA0206">From here, my generals will have a telling view of the battlefield.</String>
		<String _locID="67919" soundfilename="YAKBA0207">This geography lends itself well to the thinking of a military mind. My barracks will go here.</String>
		<String _locID="67920" soundfilename="YAKBA0208">I will build my town center here, where I can see the dawn break over every inch of my empire.</String>
		<String _locID="67921" soundfilename="YAKBA0209">I have chosen a place for my town center. This piece of paradise will be my second home.</String>
		<String _locID="67922" soundfilename="YAKBA0210">There is no doubt in my heart; this is a holy land, the perfect place to plant an empire.</String>
		<String _locID="67923" soundfilename="YAKBA0211">I advance on this small village in peace, with hopes we can work together with its people.</String>
		<String _locID="67924" soundfilename="YAKBA0212">The gods have instructed me to make a pact with these villagers, to bring them under our influence.</String>
		<String _locID="67925" soundfilename="YAKBA0213">I plan to approach these natives and extend the hand of friendship.</String>
		<String _locID="67926" soundfilename="YAKBA0214">I believe this site will make a good trade hub. The gods will it so.</String>
		<String _locID="67927" soundfilename="YAKBA0215">With your blessing, I will claim this trade site for my empire.</String>
		<String _locID="67928" soundfilename="YAKBA0216">If you cannot find me, you might look for my body here, where it fell in defense of the empire.</String>
		<String _locID="67929" soundfilename="YAKBA0217">This building must not be lost. Without it, our kingdom moves one step closer to doom.</String>
		<String _locID="67930" soundfilename="YAKBA0218">I declare this holy ground. No man will move me from it.</String>
		<String _locID="67931" soundfilename="YAKBA0219">The moment my men stepped on this ground, it became consecrated and will be defended.</String>
		<String _locID="67932" soundfilename="YAKBA0220">We have fought hard to win the friendship of these natives. We must fight harder to keep it.</String>
		<String _locID="67933" soundfilename="YAKBA0221">Our native brothers will not be forced from their lands. We must resist this attack.</String>
		<String _locID="67934" soundfilename="YAKBA0222">Why would anyone wish to burn paradise? My men will defend this town to their deaths.</String>
		<String _locID="67935" soundfilename="YAKBA0223">No enemy shall set foot in this town and live. I have declared it.</String>
		<String _locID="67936" soundfilename="YAKBA0224">This trade site cannot fall, not while the Mughal flag flies over it.</String>
		<String _locID="67937" soundfilename="YAKBA0225">It is the will of the divine that I defend this trade site. No man shall pass.</String>
		<String _locID="67938" soundfilename="YAKBA0226">A rich man should care for his impoverished brothers and sisters. Take this gold.</String>
		<String _locID="67939" soundfilename="YAKBA0227">Take this offering of gold for as long as you require it.</String>
		<String _locID="67940" soundfilename="YAKBA0228">Take this offering of food for as long as you require it.</String>
		<String _locID="67941" soundfilename="YAKBA0229">Take this offering of wood for as long as you require it.</String>
		<String _locID="67942" soundfilename="YAKBA0230">You never fight alone, my ally. You have the Mughal and the gods at your back.</String>
		<String _locID="67943" soundfilename="YAKBA0231">Reassure your embattled soldiers. Mughal armies are on the way.</String>
		<String _locID="67944" soundfilename="YAKBA0232">I have sent men to reinforce your defense. They fly like angels to your rescue.</String>
		<String _locID="67945" soundfilename="YAKBA0233">I am enjoying the quiet. Silence is a blessing, and peaceful prayer should be the goal of the soul.</String>
		<String _locID="67946" soundfilename="YAKBA0234">I am sorry if I have said little. I have been deep in meditation, praying for a decisive victory.</String>
		<String _locID="67947" soundfilename="YAKBA0235">An emperor never wants to beg for riches. But I need gold desperately.</String>
		<String _locID="67948" soundfilename="YAKBA0236">On my knees, I ask for a tribute of gold.</String>
		<String _locID="67949" soundfilename="YAKBA0237">I swallow my pride and beg you, my ally, for food.</String>
		<String _locID="67950" soundfilename="YAKBA0238">On my knees, I ask for a tribute of food.</String>
		<String _locID="67951" soundfilename="YAKBA0239">I have foolishly consumed all of my wood. Could you spare some for an ally?</String>
		<String _locID="67952" soundfilename="YAKBA0240">On my knees, I ask for a tribute of wood.</String>
		<String _locID="67953" soundfilename="YAKBA0241">Your coming was revealed to me in a dream. The gods bless our alliance.</String>
		<String _locID="67954" soundfilename="YAKBA0242">Thank you. Together, our armies will bring light to the darkness.</String>
		<String _locID="67955" soundfilename="YAKBA0243">Thank you for your aid. We shall press our enemy until he can longer breathe.</String>
		<String _locID="67956" soundfilename="YAKBA0244">Many blessings upon you. Your generosity is an example for others.</String>
		<String _locID="67957" soundfilename="YAKBA0245">No man gives his gold without some regret. Thank you for taking the generous path.</String>
		<String _locID="67958" soundfilename="YAKBA0246">Nourishment is always welcome. Many blessings upon you.</String>
		<String _locID="67959" soundfilename="YAKBA0247">This food falls into waiting hands. Thank you.</String>
		<String _locID="67960" soundfilename="YAKBA0248">Your warriors have worked miracles today. Their great sacrifice will not be forgotten.</String>
		<String _locID="67961" soundfilename="YAKBA0249">I thank you, and my people thank you. The great society lives on.</String>
		<String _locID="67962" soundfilename="YAKBA0250">The gods must have sent you. This gracious act reveals your soul's kindness.</String>
		<String _locID="67963" soundfilename="YAKBA0251">Many blessings upon you. Your gifts are very generous.</String>
		<String _locID="67964" soundfilename="YAKBA0252">These are like blessings from heaven. Thank you.</String>
		<String _locID="67965" soundfilename="YAKBA0253">Yes, this wood is welcome.</String>
		<String _locID="67966" soundfilename="YAKBA0254">You continue to earn my trust. This wood is needed.</String>
		<String _locID="67967" soundfilename="YAKBA0255">The Aztecs fight with a glorious passion. What have we done to displease the gods?</String>
		<String _locID="67968" soundfilename="YAKBA0256">The divine look down on us with disfavor. The Aztec offer greater resistance than anticipated.</String>
		<String _locID="67969" soundfilename="YAKBA0257">The British fight with a glorious passion. What have we done to displease the gods?</String>
		<String _locID="67970" soundfilename="YAKBA0258">The British dominate us, and rightly so. Their aim is true, and their blows are mighty.</String>
		<String _locID="67971" soundfilename="YAKBA0259">The Dutch fight with a glorious passion. What have we done to displease the gods?</String>
		<String _locID="67972" soundfilename="YAKBA0260">I am confused. The Dutch duel as if the gods were on their side. I must not let this shake my faith.</String>
		<String _locID="67973" soundfilename="YAKBA0261">The French fight with a glorious passion. What have we done to displease the gods?</String>
		<String _locID="67974" soundfilename="YAKBA0262">The spirits must seek to challenge us, for the French armies appear to be unstoppable.</String>
		<String _locID="67975" soundfilename="YAKBA0263">The German fight with a glorious passion. What have we done to displease the gods?</String>
		<String _locID="67976" soundfilename="YAKBA0264">If we are to dominate these Germans, we will need to start fighting like men of faith, not men of fear.</String>
		<String _locID="67977" soundfilename="YAKBA0265">The Iroquois fight with a glorious passion. What have we done to displease the gods?</String>
		<String _locID="67978" soundfilename="YAKBA0266">Even in my clearest visions, no army has clashed with as much conviction as these Iroquois.</String>
		<String _locID="67979" soundfilename="YAKBA0267">The Ottomans fight with a glorious passion. What have we done to displease the gods?</String>
		<String _locID="67980" soundfilename="YAKBA0268">We must do something soon, or this land will be one more jewel in the Ottoman Empire.</String>
		<String _locID="67981" soundfilename="YAKBA0269">The Portuguese fight with a glorious passion. What have we done to displease the gods?</String>
		<String _locID="67982" soundfilename="YAKBA0270">I grow weary fighting these tireless Portuguese. They are obsessed with ending our empire.</String>
		<String _locID="67983" soundfilename="YAKBA0271">The Russians fight with a glorious passion. What have we done to displease the gods?</String>
		<String _locID="67984" soundfilename="YAKBA0272">Our destiny has been obscured by these vicious Russians. We must reclaim it.</String>
		<String _locID="67985" soundfilename="YAKBA0273">The Sioux fight with a glorious passion. What have we done to displease the gods?</String>
		<String _locID="67986" soundfilename="YAKBA0274">If we believe that these Sioux warriors fear nothing, then we have already failed.</String>
		<String _locID="67987" soundfilename="YAKBA0275">The Spanish fight with a glorious passion. What have we done to displease the gods?</String>
		<String _locID="67988" soundfilename="YAKBA0276">Every time I look up from my dying men, the Spanish smile down at me. Where is my hope?</String>
		<String _locID="67989" soundfilename="YAKBA0277">The Chinese fight with a glorious passion. What have we done to displease the gods?</String>
		<String _locID="67990" soundfilename="YAKBA0278">We cannot let the powerful Chinese exert their influence over us. Their victories mean nothing.</String>
		<String _locID="67991" soundfilename="YAKBA0279">The Japanese fight with a glorious passion. What have we done to displease the gods?</String>
		<String _locID="67992" soundfilename="YAKBA0280">I did not see such an epic battle ahead of us. The Japanese have proved me wrong in every way.</String>
		<String _locID="67993" soundfilename="YAKBA0281">These traitorous Indians fight with a glorious passion. What have we done to displease the gods?</String>
		<String _locID="67994" soundfilename="YAKBA0282">If the traitorous Indians continue to fight so bitterly, our cause is surely lost.</String>
		<String _locID="67995" soundfilename="YAKBA0283">We will triumph over these rampaging Aztecs in the end. Our faith will sustain us in these, our darkest hours.</String>
		<String _locID="67996" soundfilename="YAKBA0284">We must hold our faith before us in the face of the British charge. We will emerge stronger.</String>
		<String _locID="67997" soundfilename="YAKBA0285">Our blood stains the boots of the Dutch, but it is all part of our greater strategy. They have used up all of their fire.</String>
		<String _locID="67998" soundfilename="YAKBA0286">I have seen no signs of a French victory. They overextend themselves to our advantage.</String>
		<String _locID="67999" soundfilename="YAKBA0287">The Germans are about to declare this war in their favor, but they do so with tired men and dulled blades. It is time to strike.</String>
		<String _locID="68000" soundfilename="YAKBA0288">I know it appears we have lost this battle, but we cannot lose hope. We will defeat these Iroquois.</String>
		<String _locID="68001" soundfilename="YAKBA0289">Trust me. The Ottomans cannot maintain this pace. Defeat will not be our destiny.</String>
		<String _locID="68002" soundfilename="YAKBA0290">The Portuguese overrun us, but their supply of soldiers will soon run out. Then, our time will come.</String>
		<String _locID="68003" soundfilename="YAKBA0291">The endurance of the Russians is great, but so is our faith. We will strike back with a decisive blow.</String>
		<String _locID="68004" soundfilename="YAKBA0292">We fall at the feet of the Sioux, but we will never surrender. I tell you, they are weakening.</String>
		<String _locID="68005" soundfilename="YAKBA0293">We are not destined for defeat this day. The Spanish will still suffer greatly.</String>
		<String _locID="68006" soundfilename="YAKBA0294">Fear not. This Chinese might is deceiving. Each of our blows chips away at their resolve.</String>
		<String _locID="68007" soundfilename="YAKBA0295">The Japanese believe they have finished us, but all of their ambition has left them weak.</String>
		<String _locID="68008" soundfilename="YAKBA0296">We may be slow but our footing is sure. The Indian betrayers have not yet won this war.</String>
		<String _locID="68009" soundfilename="YAKBA0297">You must strengthen your fight. My failures are dragging us down to defeat.</String>
		<String _locID="68010" soundfilename="YAKBA0298">You will need to battle for both of us, as my forces dwindle and lead us to despair.</String>
		<String _locID="68011" soundfilename="YAKBA0299">We survive by the grace of the gods. You must find strength in that.</String>
		<String _locID="68012" soundfilename="YAKBA0300">Defeat looms large, but there is still time. Follow my example, and fight!</String>
		<String _locID="68013" soundfilename="YAKBA0301">We should not grow to accustomed to this advantage. The enemy is cunning.</String>
		<String _locID="68014" soundfilename="YAKBA0302">The gods may bless us, but fate is a fickle thing. At any moment, fortunes could change.</String>
		<String _locID="68015" soundfilename="YAKBA0303">We must continue the attack with your sword out front. I am at your command.</String>
		<String _locID="68016" soundfilename="YAKBA0304">I have great faith in your allegiance. It has brought us this far.</String>
		<String _locID="68017" soundfilename="YAKBA0305">The battle turns in our favor, yet there is still time for mistakes. Stay near me, and learn.</String>
		<String _locID="68018" soundfilename="YAKBA0306">The gods grant us continuing strength and wisdom. We must remain obedient.</String>
		<String _locID="68019" soundfilename="YAKBA0307">We must have done something to incur this wrath. The heavens have abandoned us.</String>
		<String _locID="68020" soundfilename="YAKBA0308">A man can only fight alone for so long. Without the gods behind us, we fail.</String>
		<String _locID="68021" soundfilename="YAKBA0309">Can nothing be done? Our men fight tirelessly to what end?</String>
		<String _locID="68022" soundfilename="YAKBA0310">A shadow passes over the battlefield. It blots out the sun of our victory.</String>
		<String _locID="68023" soundfilename="YAKBA0311">We have seen our end, and it is nearly upon us.</String>
		<String _locID="68024" soundfilename="YAKBA0312">All of my faith has fallen from me. I do not know where to turn in the face of defeat.</String>
		<String _locID="68025" soundfilename="YAKBA0313">I know my destiny, and it does not end like this. We will stall this enemy drive.</String>
		<String _locID="68026" soundfilename="YAKBA0314">Our enemy seeks to defy the gods and finish this war without a fight.</String>
		<String _locID="68027" soundfilename="YAKBA0315">We must offer these natives a better alternative. Hurry to their villages.</String>
		<String _locID="68028" soundfilename="YAKBA0316">Our enemy comes to villages as conquerors. We must come as friends and liberators.</String>
		<String _locID="68029" soundfilename="YAKBA0317">This move to seize the trade route must be prevented.</String>
		<String _locID="68030" soundfilename="YAKBA0318">We must work harder to capture trade sites. In this battle, every inch of land counts.</String>
		<String _locID="68031" soundfilename="YAKBA0319">If the enemy follows this path, we will have the whole of the native population against us.</String>
		<String _locID="68032" soundfilename="YAKBA0320">Natives continue to flock to our enemy's cause. We must do something, quickly.</String>
		<String _locID="68033" soundfilename="YAKBA0321">A strong trade empire is born, but not within our borders. The enemy strengthens.</String>
		<String _locID="68034" soundfilename="YAKBA0322">We must subvert the enemy's trade ambitions if we are to claim victory.</String>
		<String _locID="68035" soundfilename="YAKBA0323">Befriending the natives is a proper course for success; the gods have willed it so.</String>
		<String _locID="68036" soundfilename="YAKBA0324">Your exhibition of tolerance and understanding has brought more to our cause.</String>
		<String _locID="68037" soundfilename="YAKBA0325">The seizure of that trade site shows you are wise in handling the weapons of war.</String>
		<String _locID="68038" soundfilename="YAKBA0326">The gods have granted you a trade site. It is cause for much thanks.</String>
		<String _locID="68039" soundfilename="YAKBA0327">Always be appreciative of the blessings given you.</String>
		<String _locID="68040" soundfilename="YAKBA0328">The gods have provided, now you must show your faith.</String>
		<String _locID="68041" soundfilename="YAKBA0329">When in doubt, the divine will lend the aid you seek.</String>
		<String _locID="68042" soundfilename="YAKBA0330">The hand of the holy ones will always be outstretched to you, oh ally.</String>
		<String _locID="68043" soundfilename="YAKBA0331">Coin is the tool of man, but in the right hands it can work miracles.</String>
		<String _locID="68044" soundfilename="YAKBA0332">You have been gifted with gold to do the divine's bidding.</String>
		<String _locID="68045" soundfilename="YAKBA0333">Your men will never starve when they are in the arms of the gods.</String>
		<String _locID="68046" soundfilename="YAKBA0334">That bread will feed your body, but it is faith that will feed your soul.</String>
		<String _locID="68047" soundfilename="YAKBA0335">Never forget from whom your blessings flow. You must always give thanks for your good fortune.</String>
		<String _locID="68048" soundfilename="YAKBA0336">Save some of nature's treasures for me, my ally. My mind is focused on other tasks.</String>
		<String _locID="68049" soundfilename="YAKBA0337">What is mine is yours. Take that offering and use it well.</String>
		<String _locID="68050" soundfilename="YAKBA0338">All who I call "friend" are welcome to the fruits of my kingdom.</String>
		<String _locID="68051" soundfilename="YAKBA0339">Your army swells with new warriors. The gods fill our ranks.</String>
		<String _locID="68052" soundfilename="YAKBA0340">I am glad you have won these fierce warriors to our side. I would not want to face them in battle.</String>
		<String _locID="68053" soundfilename="YAKBA0341">You have found settlers. Put them to work. There is no time for idle hands.</String>
		<String _locID="68054" soundfilename="YAKBA0342">More have joined us. Treat them well, and they will follow anywhere.</String>
		<String _locID="68055" soundfilename="YAKBA0343">Do you realize that this gift of wood has come from above?</String>
		<String _locID="68056" soundfilename="YAKBA0344">Does this blessing of wood not convince you that we are protected by the divine?</String>
		<String _locID="68057" soundfilename="YAKBA0345">Another native site has been added to our domain. Spirits must aid you in your work.</String>
		<String _locID="68058" soundfilename="YAKBA0346">The natives flock to you. Whatever you are doing to win them over, keep doing it.</String>
		<String _locID="68059" soundfilename="YAKBA0347">You have done well. Without a trade route, our enemies flow of resources will dry up.</String>
		<String _locID="68060" soundfilename="YAKBA0348">You have quite a rapport with the people of this region. Continue reaching out to them.</String>
		<String _locID="68061" soundfilename="YAKBA0349">A wall is but a temporary solution, whether around your heart or your headquarters.</String>
		<String _locID="68062" soundfilename="YAKBA0350">Do not allow yourself to succumb to fear. A wall will only hide your enemy, not make him disappear.</String>
		<String _locID="68063" soundfilename="YAKBA0351">I do not wish to conquer, only to explore and understand. These natives will enrich our kingdoms with their culture.</String>
		<String _locID="68064" soundfilename="YAKBA0352">I am the first to make contact with the people of these lands. Our alliance grows.</String>
		<String _locID="68065" soundfilename="YAKBA0353">With this trading post, a new chapter in the history of my empire will be written.</String>
		<String _locID="68066" soundfilename="YAKBA0354">When I need food, I find food. When I need wood, I find wood. And when I need coin, a glint of gold catches my eye. I am blessed.</String>
		<String _locID="68067" soundfilename="YAKBA0355">Are you beginning to see the logic in my faith? Everywhere I turn, my needs are met.</String>
		<String _locID="68068" soundfilename="YAKBA0356">All I acquire passes through me to my people. What you see in my hands, flows into theirs.</String>
		<String _locID="68069" soundfilename="YAKBA0357">My need for wealth is always met. The name of my empire must be written in the stars.</String>
		<String _locID="68070" soundfilename="YAKBA0358">My need for food is always met. Someone watches over me.</String>
		<String _locID="68071" soundfilename="YAKBA0359">I am taking this treasure, but only with your blessing.</String>
		<String _locID="68072" soundfilename="YAKBA0360">We have been given so much. It is right that one of us take advantage of such riches.</String>
		<String _locID="68073" soundfilename="YAKBA0361">I hope your disinterest in treasure will not result in a request for loans.</String>
		<String _locID="68074" soundfilename="YAKBA0362">You must think my ambitions grand. You have hardly searched the land for any riches.</String>
		<String _locID="68075" soundfilename="YAKBA0363">Let us welcome these warriors to our ranks. No one fights harder than a man defending his homeland.</String>
		<String _locID="68076" soundfilename="YAKBA0364">Every man has a right to defend the land of his birth, especially the natives who have joined us.</String>
		<String _locID="68077" soundfilename="YAKBA0365">These new settlers wish to join us, and we both know that a kingdom is built by its people.</String>
		<String _locID="68078" soundfilename="YAKBA0366">New settlers wish to join my society. They will not be disappointed.</String>
		<String _locID="68079" soundfilename="YAKBA0367">I fall to my knees in appreciation for this gift of wood.</String>
		<String _locID="68080" soundfilename="YAKBA0368">I raise my hands to the heavens, giving thanks for this wood.</String>
		<String _locID="68081" soundfilename="YAKBA0369">The Mughals give these natives refuge, and they give us their lands. It is a good arrangement.</String>
		<String _locID="68082" soundfilename="YAKBA0370">We must continue to steal these sites. Our enemy will wither without trade.</String>
		<String _locID="68083" soundfilename="YAKBA0371">Every trade route is another vein through which the blood of our army flows.</String>
		<String _locID="68084" soundfilename="YAKBA0372">It is sad that I must enclose my open society within hardened stone.</String>
		<String _locID="68085" soundfilename="YAKBA0373">As my heart is a barrier from fear, let this wall be a barrier from evil.</String>
		<String _locID="68086" soundfilename="YAKBA0374">With one blessed blow we have ended our enemy's tyranny. The clock is ticking.</String>
		<String _locID="68087" soundfilename="YAKBA0375">It is done. Our enemy writhes beneath us in a panic. This is a good day.</String>
		<String _locID="68088" soundfilename="YAKBA0376">You have suffered greatly in your recent confrontations. Come. You are with friends now.</String>
		<String _locID="68089" soundfilename="YAKBA0377">Every man reaches for goals that exceed his grasp. Do not worry. Your recent defeats will not plague you here.</String>
		<String _locID="68090" soundfilename="YAKBA0378">You have braved many battles in our time apart. Your face is a picture of pain, but of pride, as well.</String>
		<String _locID="68091" soundfilename="YAKBA0379">I know that expression. You have defeated many foes since last we spoke, and you crave my approval. You have it.</String>
		<String _locID="68092" soundfilename="YAKBA0380">The gods have sent me an ally with great experience. You have my sword, as I have yours.</String>
		<String _locID="68093" soundfilename="YAKBA0381">I am pleased that you have seen the world and faced its trials. Now it is time to put that experience into action.</String>
		<String _locID="68094" soundfilename="YAKBA0382">In one minute, a bright and brilliant light will fade from this world. I hope you are proud.</String>
		<String _locID="68095" soundfilename="YAKBA0383">Perhaps you have a larger role in our destinies than I realized, for it looks as if you are the victor.</String>
		<String _locID="68096" soundfilename="YAKBA0384">As the final seconds of this terrible war pass, hope springs forth renewed.</String>
		<String _locID="68097" soundfilename="YAKBA0385">Rays of goodness and enlightenment shine forth on the eve of victory.</String>
		<String _locID="68098" soundfilename="YAKBA0386">This hallowed ground has been chosen by the gods. Here, I will cleanse the earth of your evils.</String>
		<String _locID="68099" soundfilename="YAKBA0387">The future is predetermined. You can throw as many men into this war as you choose, but it will be for nothing.</String>
		<String _locID="68100" soundfilename="YAKBA0388">Remember this day and this battle. It will be your last taste of victory.</String>
		<String _locID="68101" soundfilename="YAKBA0389">This battle was rightfully mine. Please try not to stab me in the back as I retreat.</String>
		<String _locID="68102" soundfilename="YAKBA0390">Corruption and villainy may win you one skirmish, but goodness will always prevail.</String>
		<String _locID="68103" soundfilename="YAKBA0391">The blood spilled today was not spilled in vain. I have once again kept you from achieving your goals.</String>
		<String _locID="68104" soundfilename="YAKBA0392">This victory came to me in a dream. I have known of it for weeks.</String>
		<String _locID="68105" soundfilename="YAKBA0393">All in this war happens as it should. My faith was never tested, the battle never in doubt.</String>
		<String _locID="68106" soundfilename="YAKBA0394">I will tell you this, one ruler to another. There is no hope for you in this battle. The gods have spoken.</String>
		<String _locID="68107" soundfilename="YAKBA0395">My sword blazes with the righteous flame. Before this day is finished, you will kneel before me.</String>
		<String _locID="68108" soundfilename="YAKBA0396">The blessings, and the allies, rain down upon me. My grip tightens on your throat.</String>
		<String _locID="68109" soundfilename="YAKBA0397">You see, this is why you treat others with respect. They will always come to your aid, swords drawn.</String>
		<String _locID="68110" soundfilename="YAKBA0398">Enjoy this good fortune. I will find other opportunities for victory. The gods will it.</String>
		<String _locID="68111" soundfilename="YAKBA0399">Your ally brings you a victory. It is a dark day.</String>
		<String _locID="68112" soundfilename="YAKBA0400">The gods have blessed you with wisdom and progress.</String>
		<String _locID="68113" soundfilename="YAKBA0401">Your civilization is an example for the whole world. It is a pity I must destroy it.</String>
		<String _locID="68114" soundfilename="YAKBA0402">People the world over rejoice at the arrival of a new age, regardless of the kingdom.</String>
		<String _locID="68115" soundfilename="YAKBA0403">Each day brings new villages to your empire. Treat them with respect.</String>
		<String _locID="68116" soundfilename="YAKBA0404">Your hollow promises will fail to satisfy these natives, and when they do, I will be waiting.</String>
		<String _locID="68117" soundfilename="YAKBA0405">If you have cause for harm against me, do not take it out on the people of my empire.</String>
		<String _locID="68118" soundfilename="YAKBA0406">This is a great tragedy. These natives will be avenged. The gods will it.</String>
		<String _locID="68119" soundfilename="YAKBA0407">I am not afraid. An empire is not based in a building, but in the hearts of its people.</String>
		<String _locID="68120" soundfilename="YAKBA0408">You may have destroyed our capital, but our empire fights on.</String>
		<String _locID="68121" soundfilename="YAKBA0409">The loss of a trading post is nothing to mourn. The gods will provide for us.</String>
		<String _locID="68122" soundfilename="YAKBA0410">You waste time attacking my trade route. My men are busy elsewhere, with more important matters.</String>
		<String _locID="68123" soundfilename="YAKBA0411">A weak empire is the sign of a weak ruler. Your civilization lags behind the rest of us.</String>
		<String _locID="68124" soundfilename="YAKBA0412">I do not wish to attack a defenseless foe. You must advance to train soldiers.</String>
		<String _locID="68125" soundfilename="YAKBA0413">The divine has given all of us the potential for great things. Use it, or remain ignorant.</String>
		<String _locID="68126" soundfilename="YAKBA0414">You are holding back your society with this focus on warfare. Advance or perish.</String>
		<String _locID="68127" soundfilename="YAKBA0415">You have set an example for the rest of us. I have great respect for an advanced empire.</String>
		<String _locID="68128" soundfilename="YAKBA0416">The gods watch over you. I do not understand it, but I know better than to question it.</String>
		<String _locID="68129" soundfilename="YAKBA0417">If you had waited any longer to advance, I would have questioned your right to participate in this battle.</String>
		<String _locID="68130" soundfilename="YAKBA0418">You have much to prove, advancing so late. Your society should be shunned.</String>
		<String _locID="68131" soundfilename="YAKBA0419">Your distance from your allies betrays you. The relationship is not as close as you claim.</String>
		<String _locID="68132" soundfilename="YAKBA0420">It is not a good sign that your allies settle so far from you. Have you offended them?</String>
		<String _locID="68133" soundfilename="YAKBA0421">With enemies clustered so closely together, I fear a confrontation of epic proportions.</String>
		<String _locID="68134" soundfilename="YAKBA0422">It is good for you to be located near your allies, but, alas, it is bad for me.</String>
		<String _locID="68135" soundfilename="YAKBA0423">I have extinguished your threat. Your clever tricks will not work against me.</String>
		<String _locID="68136" soundfilename="YAKBA0424">It does not bring me pleasure to defeat you. I  do it only to show you the error of your ways.</String>
		<String _locID="68137" soundfilename="YAKBA0425">You should know better than to lead these innocent people to their doom.</String>
		<String _locID="68138" soundfilename="YAKBA0426">An unavoidable tragedy. In my society, this would not have happened.</String>
		<String _locID="68139" soundfilename="YAKBA0427">You will learn to forgive me in time. I had little choice.</String>
		<String _locID="68140" soundfilename="YAKBA0428">Your town center represented all that was wrong with your civilization.</String>
		<String _locID="68141" soundfilename="YAKBA0429">The pursuit of wealth brings with it only greed. That trade site was a bad influence.</String>
		<String _locID="68142" soundfilename="YAKBA0430">This site would have been better utilized under my control.</String>
		<String _locID="68143" soundfilename="YAKBA0431">I have foreseen a future without war. Until that day is here I will fight to preserve my empire.</String>
		<String _locID="68144" soundfilename="YAKBA0432">War is for the unenlightened. I am furious that you have driven me to take such action.</String>
		<String _locID="68145" soundfilename="YAKBA0433">Confident, are we? Perhaps you expect too much from this adventure. War should never be taken lightly.</String>
		<String _locID="68146" soundfilename="YAKBA0434">You have chosen a very difficult battle. You may be mighty, but you have not yet learned humility.</String>
		<String _locID="68147" soundfilename="YAKBA0435">It is wise of you to confront a lesser challenge this time. You have not yet shown your worth.</String>
		<String _locID="68148" soundfilename="YAKBA0436">It seems you have come to your senses and realized that your men are not lions, but mice.</String>
		<String _locID="68149" soundfilename="YAKBA0437">Do you remember this holy land? It has been chosen as the site of my greatest victory.</String>
		<String _locID="68150" soundfilename="YAKBA0438">You are wise to face a lesser challenge. It is for the best...I have seen you fight.</String>
		<String _locID="68151" soundfilename="YAKBA0439">By battling such odds, you must assume to have the support of the divine.</String>
		<String _locID="68152" soundfilename="YAKBA0440">We have rescued our Brahmin. There is nothing you can do to dampen his faith.</String>
		<String _locID="68153" soundfilename="YAKBA0441">Your men hope to spread their influence where it is not wanted. Leave these lands.</String>
		<String _locID="68154" soundfilename="YAKBA0442">Soldiers trample the grass around us. Surrender now, before more blood is shed.</String>
		<String _locID="68155" soundfilename="YAKBA0443">Your warriors look drained of courage. Send them to me, and I will show them mercy.</String>
		<String _locID="68156" soundfilename="YAKBA0444">I have glimpsed your men, and seen a future filled only with death. Turn back.</String>
		<String _locID="68157" soundfilename="YAKBA0445">If your men dare attack me, you will be meddling with the work of the gods.</String>
		<String _locID="68158" soundfilename="YAKBA0446">I see your movements and suggest keeping this war on the battlefield. Do not involve families and farmers.</String>
		<String _locID="68159" soundfilename="YAKBA0447">Such barbarism! You ask for the gods' wrath, and they shall answer you in kind.</String>
		<String _locID="68160" soundfilename="YAKBA0448">For every act of murder committed today, I will visit them back upon you twofold.</String>
		<String _locID="68161" soundfilename="YAKBA0449">Such a sea of men is only good for one thing. Have you come to finish this dance?</String>
		<String _locID="68162" soundfilename="YAKBA0450">An army of this size is only meant to terrify. With the gods strength, I will not be intimidated.</String>
		<String _locID="68163" soundfilename="YAKBA0451">Your men, like you, seem lost and without direction. Perhaps they should join my great society.</String>
		<String _locID="68164" soundfilename="YAKBA0452">Are your men hoping to see what an enlightened kingdom looks like? They are welcome to.</String>
		<String _locID="68165" soundfilename="YABKA0453">Only the ignorant seek to destroy the enlightened. You know not what you do.</String>
		<String _locID="68166" soundfilename="YAKBA0454">You have caught me by surprise, but my faith will save me. I will not forsake it.</String>
		<String _locID="68167" soundfilename="YAKBA0455">If we were at peace I could let your men walk these lands unmolested. But, we are not.</String>
		<String _locID="68168" soundfilename="YAKBA0456">Is this a small band of migrants wishing to join my cause?</String>
		<String _locID="68169" soundfilename="YAKBA0457">I have seen the capital of your empire, and I am very disappointed.</String>
		<String _locID="68170" soundfilename="YAKBA0458">Tell me. Do you really believe that this lowly town can be the heart of a great empire?</String>
		<String _locID="68171" soundfilename="YAKBA0459">It brings me no pleasure to steal riches from one who needs them.</String>
		<String _locID="68172" soundfilename="YAKBA0460">The truth is obvious. The gods side with me in every battle.</String>
		<String _locID="68173" soundfilename="YAKBA0461">I never wished for conquest, but it has come to that. My men are nearly upon you.</String>
		<String _locID="68174" soundfilename="YAKBA0462">You have resisted our calls for cooperation for the last time. Prepare to meet your fate.</String>
		<String _locID="68175" soundfilename="YAKBA0463">I am curious. Why do you wish to see the great society destroyed?</String>
		<String _locID="68176" soundfilename="YAKBA0464">The fronts lie silent. Is this a message? Do you wish to end this war?</String>
		<String _locID="68177" soundfilename="YAKBA0465">It is the sad reality that you bring no faith to this battlefield. The gods are on my side.</String>
		<String _locID="68178" soundfilename="YAKBA0466">I cannot bear to see this empire burn. I beg of you. Spare my people.</String>
		<String _locID="68179" soundfilename="YAKBA0467">Today is as good as any to see my empire fall, if the gods so desire it.</String>
		<String _locID="68180" soundfilename="YAKBA0468">The divine have ended my threat and given you another day of life. Cherish it.</String>
		<String _locID="68181" soundfilename="YAKBA0469">Your civilization absorbs many in its quest for glory. Is this to please your people...or yourself?</String>
		<String _locID="68182" soundfilename="YAKBA0470">A trade empire is a sign of a healthy economy, and in your case, probably a corrupt one.</String>
		<String _locID="68183" soundfilename="YAKBA0471">Predictable. You value treasure first, human life second.</String>
		<String _locID="68184" soundfilename="YAKBA0472">No amount of resources will prevent your inevitable downfall.</String>
		<String _locID="68185" soundfilename="YAKBA0473">You should be thankful, as the gods provide for you.</String>
		<String _locID="68186" soundfilename="YAKBA0474">A poor man thinks before spending, but a rich man spends before thinking. Which are you?</String>
		<String _locID="68187" soundfilename="YAKBA0475">Your people should be down on bended knees, thanking the heavens for this food.</String>
		<String _locID="68188" soundfilename="YAKBA0476">Ration every morsel to the fullest, for it is truly a gift from above.</String>
		<String _locID="68189" soundfilename="YAKBA0477">I hope your race for treasures is for the good of your society, and not for yourself.</String>
		<String _locID="68190" soundfilename="YAKBA0478">I expected you to conduct yourself as a ruler, not a thief. You test my patience.</String>
		<String _locID="68191" soundfilename="YAKBA0479">It is dishonorable to steal from another when your storehouses are so full.</String>
		<String _locID="68192" soundfilename="YAKBA0480">These men pledge themselves to you. I hope you appreciate this honorable sacrifice.</String>
		<String _locID="68193" soundfilename="YAKBA0481">You are wrong to recruit followers only to order them to their deaths. You should be ashamed.</String>
		<String _locID="68194" soundfilename="YAKBA0482">I do not understand how you continue to win new villagers.</String>
		<String _locID="68195" soundfilename="YAKBA0483">Without the skill to craft it, that wood will do you little good.</String>
		<String _locID="68196" soundfilename="YAKBA0484">A closed society has nothing to offer the rest of humanity. Tear down your walls.</String>
		<String _locID="68197" soundfilename="YAKBA0485">If you do not remove your walls, the gods will remove them on my behalf.</String>
		<String _locID="68198" soundfilename="YAKBA0486">I welcome all into my fold, even these lost and savage villagers.</String>
		<String _locID="68199" soundfilename="YAKBA0487">Great men open their arms to embrace all peoples, as I embrace these natives.</String>
		<String _locID="68200" soundfilename="YAKBA0488">I am blessed. This trade site will provide great things for my empire.</String>
		<String _locID="68201" soundfilename="YAKBA0489">This trade site will benefit my great society, not yours.</String>
		<String _locID="68202" soundfilename="YAKBA0490">I will use all of creation to end your empire.</String>
		<String _locID="68203" soundfilename="YAKBA0491">I will use whatever the gods provide to stop the madness of war.</String>
		<String _locID="68204" soundfilename="YAKBA0492">I will thank the heavens for every gift, every weapon I may use against you.</String>
		<String _locID="68205" soundfilename="YAKBA0493">I will use the gold of the earth to purchase your destruction.</String>
		<String _locID="68206" soundfilename="YAKBA0494">I will use the food of the fields to fatten my armies.</String>
		<String _locID="68207" soundfilename="YAKBA0495">I consider this gift an offering to the poor of my empire. They thank you.</String>
		<String _locID="68208" soundfilename="YAKBA0496">Take my advice.  Trust in the gods, and you will find open the gates to a kingdom of riches.</String>
		<String _locID="68209" soundfilename="YAKBA0497">These holy warriors will live to see paradise. The gods have willed it.</String>
		<String _locID="68210" soundfilename="YAKBA0498">The gods have provided villagers to walk the enlightened path.</String>
		<String _locID="68211" soundfilename="YAKBA0499">I will use the wood of the forests to set your villages aflame.</String>
		<String _locID="68212" soundfilename="YAKBA0500">As you claim that village, remember that a great empire shows tolerance to all peoples.</String>
		<String _locID="68213" soundfilename="YAKBA0501">You seek commerce when you should seek salvation.</String>
		<String _locID="68214" soundfilename="YAKBA0502">My armies stand poised to end your victory. The gods have willed it.</String>

		<String _locID="70552">The number of British Redcoats is quite intimidating. Fortunately, their red color makes them easy targets!</String>
		<String _locID="70553">The Dutch fight so vigorously, it is as if they consider New Amsterdam to be their actual capital.</String>
		<String _locID="70554">The French are going too far by bringing their revolution to us — but I suppose that we might have inspired them.</String>
		<String _locID="70555">A deadly offensive by all the Germans is imminent. As if these Hessian mercenaries weren't enough!</String>
		<String _locID="70556">The Ottomans do not bombard you with questions, for they have far more practice in bombarding towns. Our towns.</String>
		<String _locID="70557">The Portuguese have some good shots in their army. Even our best firearms seem to be no match.</String>
		<String _locID="70558">The Tsar's forces are preparing for a rush. Be vigilant!</String>
		<String _locID="70559">The Spanish have assembled a sizable army! Let us see how their tercios hold up against our infantry tactics.</String>
		<String _locID="70560">The Swedes are expanding their empire. We must push them back!</String>
		<String _locID="70561">Chinese inventors are trying to outsmart us. We must not allow that to happen!</String>

		<String _locID="70565">Would you mind sharing your scientific progress with us?</String>

		<String _locID="70570">Is it wise to continue our fight?</String>
		<String _locID="70571">My settlements are under attack! Send your army, and my militias will buy time to organize a defense!</String>
		<String _locID="70572">The time is now near at hand which must probably determine whether Americans are to be freemen or slaves.</String>
		<String _locID="70573">Liberty, when it begins to take root, is a plant of rapid growth.</String>
		<String _locID="70574">The harder the conflict, the greater the triumph.</String>
		<String _locID="70575">My men will still fight with the same vigor, even if it only means winning faster.</String>
		<String _locID="70576">You have proven yourself a wise general. I am pleased to have your expertise on our side.</String>
		<String _locID="70577">I, this day, declare with the utmost sincerity, I do not think myself equal to the presence I am honored with.</String>
		<String _locID="70578">I am pleased to see that you have decided to join our alliance.</String>
		<String _locID="70579">Fear not, old friend — I will bring us victory once more.</String>
		<String _locID="70580">It is not a little pleasing, nor less wonderful to contemplate, that both armies are brought back to the very point they set out from, and the offending party in the beginning is now reduced to the use of the spade and pickaxe for defence.</String>
		<String _locID="70581">Let us work together, and we will be unstoppable this time.</String>
		<String _locID="70582">Let us prove once more that our alliance cannot be defeated.</String>
		<String _locID="70583">They dared to take my explorer hostage. I had no choice but to pay an outrageous ransom!</String>
		<String _locID="70584">Few men have the virtue to withstand the highest bidder.</String>
		<String _locID="70585">Check in your pocket — the quarter is me too.</String>
		<String _locID="70586">Our granaries are full enough, we have sent what we can spare.</String>
		<String _locID="70587">Oley Valley's fields have produced enough of a surplus to feed both of us for some time.</String>
		<String _locID="70588">We sent you about one redwood tree. Knock on wood!</String>
		<String _locID="70589">Our great wilderness has all the lumber that we need.</String>
		<String _locID="70590">My army will strike their bases to cut off further reinforcements!</String>
		<String _locID="70591">We will burn their homes to the ground, and the rest of their empire shall soon follow.</String>
		<String _locID="70592">This punitive expedition will teach the locals to never dare to side with the enemy again!</String>
		<String _locID="70593">There is a trade embargo against you — we are about to enforce it.</String>
		<String _locID="70594">Experience teaches us that it is much easier to prevent an enemy from posting themselves than it is to dislodge them after they have got possession.</String>
		<String _locID="70595">I will increase my military production. The enemy will be overwhelmed by our masses.</String>
		<String _locID="70596">My pioneers will quickly establish a new town center.</String>
		<String _locID="70597">We have a gold rush in our lands. I will share some of the nuggets with you.</String>
		<String _locID="70598">Thanks to steel plows and canals, we have an abundance of food.</String>
		<String _locID="70599">We had to clear some forests to expand our empire of liberty — have some lumber.</String>
		<String _locID="70600">Washington will always help an ally in need.</String>
		<String _locID="70601">To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace.</String>
		<String _locID="70602">It seems that the enemy has decided to avoid treading on us today.</String>
		<String _locID="70603">I am under no apprehension of a capital injury from any other source than that of the continual depreciation of our money. I am thus required to ask for support in foreign currency.</String>
		<String _locID="70604">My armies have run out of supplies! We need food to strengthen our numbers.</String>
		<String _locID="70605">Our military flutists have no instruments with which to play music, for our wood stock is diminishing. Can you spare some?</String>
		<String _locID="70606">Your payment has been received. I owe you a great deal.</String>
		<String _locID="70607">Thanks to your supplies, we will fight the enemy with renewed vigor.</String>
		<String _locID="70608">Many thanks. I've passed the wood to my engineers. They wouldn't stop talking about 'repeating guns' and 'breechloaders'.</String>
		<String _locID="70609">The Aztecs have sent us the shield, arrows, and cloaks. I fear that our defeat is imminent.</String>
		<String _locID="70610">I heard that the British King George found me quite revolting, but I believe that is why we are losing.</String>
		<String _locID="70611">How do the Dutch successfully control such a vast empire from such a tiny spot in Europe?</String>
		<String _locID="70612">I hope that we are pardoned by the French.</String>
		<String _locID="70613">The Germans seem very upset about not being able to read our laws in their language. I suggest that we let them settle in Pennsylvania!</String>
		<String _locID="70614">We have been cut down like a cherry tree.</String>
		<String _locID="70615">I am afraid to construct new magazines. The Ottoman artillery barrage is too heavy.</String>
		<String _locID="70616">In our history, we never had to fight against the Portuguese. It should have stayed this way.</String>
		<String _locID="70617">It was foolish of me to believe that the Russians could be toppled as easily as the British with the mere size of our militia army.</String>
		<String _locID="70618">It seems unlikely that the Spanish are going to decide between California and Texas. They will get them both back.</String>
		<String _locID="70619">Did no one tell the Swedes that monarchies are outdated? They were supposed to lose!</String>
		<String _locID="70620">That was not fair! The Chinese have hundreds of years' more experience with gunpowder weapons.</String>
		<String _locID="70621">I have a feeling that we should not have given the Japanese a reason to leave their island.</String>
		<String _locID="70622">Why did we decide to fight against camels and elephants again?</String>
		<String _locID="70623">The Aztecs bribed our naive militiamen with chocolate. This defeat is bittersweet.</String>
		<String _locID="70624">We have driven the British into financial ruin as planned, but at what cost?</String>
		<String _locID="70625">Losing half of their country to Spain only made those Dutch better at fighting.</String>
		<String _locID="70626">Is it too late to return Louisiana for a refund?</String>
		<String _locID="70627">My ill-disciplined militiamen agreed to drink with the Germans. Soon we will all eat sauerkraut!</String>
		<String _locID="70628">How are we expected to win against a foe that knows these lands like their back pocket?</String>
		<String _locID="70629">I knew that it was over when our soldiers started following the Ottoman marching bands rather than our own.</String>
		<String _locID="70630">An entire militia regiment was routed by a single Portuguese organ gun. I can already hear the organ music from the funeral.</String>
		<String _locID="70631">That was not a fair fight — the Russians were rushing us!</String>
		<String _locID="70632">It is time to blow a little big horn of retreat!</String>
		<String _locID="70633">My lousy militiamen went home, claiming that the light reflecting off the shiny Spanish armor and weapons made it impossible to aim.</String>
		<String _locID="70634">The Swedes brought a knife to a gunfight — and still won.</String>
		<String _locID="70635">So many unique units that we just could not counter all of them.</String>
		<String _locID="70636">One more of those banzai charges and my nation will be overrun.</String>
		<String _locID="70637">The Indians might not have built the most impressive wonders this time, but they impressively defeated my army.</String>
		<String _locID="70638">We are outgunned — outmanned — outnumbered — outplanned.</String>
		<String _locID="70639">There can be no greater error than to expect, or calculate, upon real favors from nation to nation.</String>
		<String _locID="70640">My first wish is to see this plague of mankind, war, banished from the earth.</String>
		<String _locID="70641">It is an honor to serve at your side, my friend. Let me know if you are interested in joining the Union.</String>
		<String _locID="70642">Do not worry, my friend — war is not for everyone. I can handle this if you wish to stay back and manage your economy for some time.</String>
		<String _locID="70643">Though, in reviewing the incidents of my administration, I am unconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors.</String>
		<String _locID="70644">The Fire of Freedom is quenched. Let us accept defeat before our nation is nothing but ruins.</String>
		<String _locID="70645">I have fought hard for the American dream, but now I must face reality and accept defeat.</String>
		<String _locID="70646">Our enemy lives a life of wealth through trade. If we let them continue like this, it will put my treasury to shame.</String>
		<String _locID="70647">The natives of this region are wise and powerful. I would be prudent to introduce myself to them as well.</String>
		<String _locID="70648">Nice find! My explorer is still warming up, it seems.</String>
		<String _locID="70649">Good catch.</String>
		<String _locID="70650">You can send it to me — I will invest it wisely.</String>
		<String _locID="70651">Enjoy your snack and the American way of life.</String>
		<String _locID="70652">You are doing well in this scavenger hunt.</String>
		<String _locID="70653">I was about to go get that one, but have a nice day.</String>
		<String _locID="70654">Recruiting the help of the locals has won many a battle.</String>
		<String _locID="70655">Having more workers never hurts.</String>
		<String _locID="70656">You can build some fine architecture with those materials.</String>
		<String _locID="70657">Finders, keepers.</String>
		<String _locID="70658">Give me liberty — or give me coin!</String>
		<String _locID="70659">I discovered where the wild wings are.</String>
		<String _locID="70660">You are a capable leader. You do not need this little treasure.</String>
		<String _locID="70661">To me, the hunt for treasure fits together perfectly with the pursuit of happiness.</String>
		<String _locID="70662">I will recruit some natives. They have valuable skills that will complement my armies.</String>
		<String _locID="70663">I am always happy to accept a few more laborers in the Union.</String>
		<String _locID="70664">Some lumber to expand further into the wilderness.</String>
		<String _locID="70665">Sometimes it is prudent to occupy a position and fortify it.</String>
		<String _locID="70666">Hold on just a little longer, and we have this one in the bag!</String>
		<String _locID="70667">It looks like it is time to enact my secret master plan.</String>
		<String _locID="70668">I hope that this taught you a little lesson in trickery.</String>
		<String _locID="70669">You might have the technology, but I have the army.</String>
		<String _locID="70670">Do not worry about aging up. We will soon come to civilize your empire.</String>
		<String _locID="70671">Is your education system a little behind?</String>
		<String _locID="70672">I have decided to delay my advancement to give you a chance.</String>
		<String _locID="70673">I am impressed. Will you learn to read next?</String>
		<String _locID="70674">We have been waiting for you. Actually, I was about to advance again.</String>
		<String _locID="70675">You seem alone. I will send an army to keep you company.</String>
		<String _locID="70676">Did you really think that I would confuse my ally's town with yours?</String>
		<String _locID="70677">We do not accept such greedy restrictions on our free trade!</String>
		<String _locID="70678">The preservation of the sacred fire of liberty is entrusted to the hands of the American people. Are you American?</String>
		<String _locID="70679">I will not be going easy on you this time.</String>
		<String _locID="70680">Good luck, have fun.</String>
		<String _locID="70681">Let us see who wins when we are more familiar with the land.</String>
		<String _locID="70682">Do you need all of these allies to fight against my United States?</String>
		<String _locID="70683">We will not be going easy on you this time.</String>
		<String _locID="70684">Welcome to the land of the free. Your explorer is also free to leave.</String>
		<String _locID="70685">Your militia does not stand a chance against mine. I am not impressed.</String>
		<String _locID="70686">What are you doing here? Providing target practice for my men?</String>
		<String _locID="70687">All you have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.</String>
		<String _locID="70688">My base is fortified and my men are rested. Are you sure about this attack?</String>
		<String _locID="70689">Are you sure that you want to occupy my town? I am good at fighting off oppressors.</String>
		<String _locID="70690">Are you sending us men to fill the ranks of our militia army? That is very nice of you.</String>
		<String _locID="70691">Is that your state? It seems too small and irrelevant to join the United States of America.</String>
		<String _locID="70692">I am George Washington and I believe in life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness — but not for you.</String>
		<String _locID="70693">My name is George Washington and I'm the president of the United States of America. And all of these states have united to defeat you.</String>
		<String _locID="70694">The unfortunate condition of the persons, whose labour in part I employed, has been the only unavoidable subject of regret.</String>
		<String _locID="70695">It is better to offer no excuse than a bad one.</String>
		<String _locID="70696">If you want to do it the hard way, we can arrange that.</String>
		<String _locID="70697">Do not expect to get more than that.</String>
		<String _locID="70698">You can collect as many treasures as you wish — my army will crush you just the same.</String>
		<String _locID="70699">Why are you in such a gold rush? It is just a bad California dream.</String>
		<String _locID="70700">Were you starving so badly that you started eating from the floor?</String>
		<String _locID="70701">What are you? Some kind of bounty hunter? I shall put this into the Marshal's matters.</String>
		<String _locID="70702">Will you keep roaming the country forever or eventually start a real business?</String>
		<String _locID="70703">I will not accept such thievery!</String>
		<String _locID="70704">Are you bribing the locals? I doubt that they would follow you on their own accord.</String>
		<String _locID="70705">I think that those settlers will regret their choice soon enough.</String>
		<String _locID="70706">I have no use for such puny treasures.</String>
		<String _locID="70707">Are you hiding? Those walls will not keep you safe.</String>
		<String _locID="70708">The native inhabitants simply like me better than you.</String>
		<String _locID="70709">The first of many — I will build an empire of free trade.</String>
		<String _locID="70710">A small prize for a man, but a huge fortune for mankind.</String>
		<String _locID="70711">I heard that finding a penny brings luck. This is a good omen.</String>
		<String _locID="70712">That is what I call fast food.</String>
		<String _locID="70713">It looks like you did not want that one anyways.</String>
		<String _locID="70714">I have found so many treasures. I will exhibit this notoriously big collection in the White House.</String>
		<String _locID="70715">The locals offer their friendship. We should count ourselves fortunate.</String>
		<String _locID="70716">We welcome those yearning to breathe free. I am sure that more will join soon.</String>
		<String _locID="70717">I think that I found about half of a redwood tree, and will put it to good use.</String>
		<String _locID="70718">We do not need any help to triumph over your puny empire.</String>
		<String _locID="70719">This trading post will not enable you to rise from rags to riches, but you can wipe the place clean and get out of there.</String>
		<String _locID="70720">You think that you can defeat us when it comes to trade? I doubt that.</String>
		<String _locID="70721">We do not need violence when we can win with the power of capitalism.</String>
		<String _locID="70722">Bring the mortars and every blade and man you can! We must stop them now!</String>
		<String _locID="70723">One minute, one monopoly, one magnificent victory for us! The Holy Trinity!</String>
		<String _locID="70724">Nothing would please me more, friend.</String>
		<String _locID="70725">The Order will put everything in order!</String>
		<String _locID="70726">You men, with me! Bring that bombard.</String>
		<String _locID="70727">Understood. Send the knights through the fort and wipe out those bombards!</String>
		<String _locID="70728">The armies of heaven, wearing pure, white linen, will follow you on white horses.</String>
		<String _locID="70729">Our brethren mercilessly march to your mission, lord.</String>
		<String _locID="70730">My coffers are empty and my gunpowder is depleted.</String>
		<String _locID="70731">I must respectfully decline. This is not in the interest of the order.</String>
		<String _locID="70732">I have a few weapons left, but no soldiers to carry them.</String>
		<String _locID="70733">I have the faith, but not the means.</String>
		<String _locID="70734">New recruits are still arriving as we speak.</String>
		<String _locID="70735">The order's trade network, wasted!</String>
		<String _locID="70736">We have reduced the United States into one last United State.</String>
		<String _locID="70737">What do you think, my dear ally? If Aztec Coyote Runners were knighted, would they be Blade Runner Knights?</String>
		<String _locID="70738">It is settled. Compared to this British pirate Elisabeth, the brethren of Malta are the better islanders!</String>
		<String _locID="70739">The Dutch may be bleeding coins, but – they are bleeding!</String>
		<String _locID="70740">I regret the need to destroy my old French homeland, but this apostasy could not be tolerated!</String>
		<String _locID="70741">The Germans are almost defeated. Since their "holy empire" is already divided, we only need to split the spoils!</String>
		<String _locID="70742">The Iroquois still have a longhouse left, but our blades are cutting it shorter by the minute.</String>
		<String _locID="70743">After we capture Italy, I will rename Sicily to "Great Malta".</String>
		<String _locID="70744">Gran Colombia has revolted one too many times. I suggest the Order should be their next government.</String>
		<String _locID="70745">We have beaten back the Ottoman invasion at Malta – we will beat them back again!</String>
		<String _locID="70746">My Order may have lost some islands in the past, but the Portuguese just lost one too many Town Centers!</String>
		<String _locID="70747">It seems the Russian Tsar was fighting us as much as his own people – and lost to both.</String>
		<String _locID="70748">We have taken out all Sioux teepees – nowhere left to hide!</String>
		<String _locID="70749">The Spanish treasure fleet is ours – and anything else they were hiding!</String>
		<String _locID="70750">The Swedish have charged the wrong hill to die on. Now they are over the hills and far away.</String>
		<String _locID="70751">The Chinese walls were built on sand. They will not last long now.</String>
		<String _locID="70752">We will not chop off any heads like the Japanese Samurai. Having to live with their defeat will be much worse for them.</String>
		<String _locID="70753">Putting guns on camels was a bad idea. They wiggle too much while running!</String>
		<String _locID="70754">The Americans are in my dreams. Cowboys chase me through the night to the beat of their gatling guns!</String>
		<String _locID="70755">These Obsidian arrowheads of the Aztec Arrow Knights are incredible! Cannons appear like a malinvestment now.</String>
		<String _locID="70756">Their rockets look more frightening than they are, but their longbows are more frightening than they look.</String>
		<String _locID="70757">The Dutch can hold out in a siege for a decade, but so can I!</String>
		<String _locID="70758">I had a premonition of my fate, it was the hoof of a French cuirassier.</String>
		<String _locID="70759">The German needle guns are turning my knights into hedgehogs!</String>
		<String _locID="70760">Iroquois cannons might be light, but they still shoot heavy cannonballs!</String>
		<String _locID="70761">The Italians have a lot faith in themselves. I understand this is why their architects construct these great Basilicas.</String>
		<String _locID="70762">The Colombians achieved the impossible and formed Gran Colombia. Now they're scarier than ever!</String>
		<String _locID="70763">The Ottoman army seems to be strong, but they forget one thing: THIS - IS - MALTA!</String>
		<String _locID="70764">The Portuguese expansion is concerning. We either bring our cannons in range – or wait for their Town Centers to be in range.</String>
		<String _locID="70765">The Russian aggression is relentless! Their nimble Cossacks seem to slip through the cracks in our walls.</String>
		<String _locID="70766">I saw heaven standing open. There was a white horse, and its rider is named Faithful and True. With integrity, he judges and wages war. He is the Sioux Rifle Rider.</String>
		<String _locID="70767">If we do not take action soon, my beloved Malta will become a Spanish colony.</String>
		<String _locID="70768">The Swedish king Gustavus seems to have more than one ace up his sleeve.</String>
		<String _locID="70769">The Chinese weapons are as innovative as ours, but it is the sheer amount of gunpowder that may pulverize our forts.</String>
		<String _locID="70770">I am starting to understand why Japan was never conquered, whereas our order may have lost an island – or two.</String>
		<String _locID="70771">The Indian economy flourishes, but it is based on wood. Let us throw flames, rockets, and burning hoops at it!</String>
		<String _locID="70772">Your progress is a shining example for all allies and enemies alike!</String>
		<String _locID="70773">I admire the technological prowess displayed by your people. Care to share your secrets with the Order?</String>
		<String _locID="70774">May you have forgotten to send shipments from the Home City? Or were they intercepted by ... Pirates?! Aarg! I hate those pirates!</String>
		<String _locID="70775">You should read a good book. Or better, a whole library! Then you will see the light! – of the next age.</String>
		<String _locID="70776">Such an impressive start, my ally! You may now cast the first stone at our sinful enemies!</String>
		<String _locID="70777">I held them back while you aged up, now it's your turn!</String>
		<String _locID="70778">Malta has been overrun! We need to find a new island, again!</String>
		<String _locID="70779">My knights are under siege once again. Send reinforcements, we will make them pay!</String>
		<String _locID="70780">I am Alain Magnan! The shield of Europe! The 49th Grand Inquisitor of the Order of the Knights of Saint John of Jerusalem!</String>
		<String _locID="70781">Together, we can beat any challenge fate can put before us!</String>
		<String _locID="70782">This will be a walk in the park, with an enemy Town Center in the way.</String>
		<String _locID="70783">Your skills have impressed me last game, now I will show you some of mine!</String>
		<String _locID="70784">Maybe you can teach this old Templar some new tricks.</String>
		<String _locID="70785">Had enough sparring with me? Let us try our teamwork, then.</String>
		<String _locID="70786">I do not mind doing the heavy lifting, but you can take the lead this round.</String>
		<String _locID="70787">Once more unto the breach, dear friend! Same old breach!</String>
		<String _locID="70788">Our ship is badly damaged. Start a colony on this land and wait for more ships to arrive from Malta.</String>
		<String _locID="70789">Our alliance was already unstoppable last game! Now that we are warmed up, they have no chance!</String>
		<String _locID="70790">I once got captured by Barbary Pirates and held on a galley for a year. Now I am Grand Inquisitor.</String>
		<String _locID="70791">I sent you a boatload of financial support.</String>
		<String _locID="70792">My fishermen have delivered their last catch on their Luzzus right to your stockpiles.</String>
		<String _locID="70793">This land has more forests than we are used to from Malta.</String>
		<String _locID="70794">Sound the trumpets — it is time for a charge!</String>
		<String _locID="70795">Let us hit them where it hurts! — their trading posts.</String>
		<String _locID="70796">Today we fight! A wall of steel bound by our vows.</String>
		<String _locID="70797">I will build a fortress here, a lighthouse of safety in a sea of darkness.</String>
		<String _locID="70798">Our Covered Wagon has arrived. We must use it to build a Town Center near the Trading Post.</String>
		<String _locID="70799">You will get your gold, but be cautious. These are unfamiliar waters.</String>
		<String _locID="70800">I intend to build an economy ready to feed an army of lions! I might have some food over for yours as well.</String>
		<String _locID="70801">I ordered too many saws and axes. I intend to put them all to use so I will have some wood to send for your own building projects.</String>
		<String _locID="70802">I will never abandon a friend in time of need, my brethren are ready to restore order wherever necessary!</String>
		<String _locID="70803">My soldiers are getting tired of guard service. We need a proper battle to bring everyone back in line!</String>
		<String _locID="70804">Our corso was not as successful as I hoped, do you have gold to spare for the upkeep of my army?</String>
		<String _locID="70805">My grain shipments were stolen by pirates. Could you please spare some for my people?</String>
		<String _locID="70806">The construction of my new capital was halted due to a lack of timber. If you can send some, I will dedicate the next building to your honor!</String>
		<String _locID="70807">I am both terrified and amazed by the innovative weaponry of the Americans. They beat us at our own game.</String>
		<String _locID="70808">Those Aztec Skull Knights seem more knightly than my own ones! They truly fight to the bone.</String>
		<String _locID="70809">It is like the Battle of Crécy all over again: British Longbowmen defeating heavily armored knights.</String>
		<String _locID="70810">The Dutch must be manipulating the tulip markets again, with the way they are making bank.</String>
		<String _locID="70811">Sacre bleu! Even our finest halberds have trouble dealing with fully upgraded French Cuirassiers!</String>
		<String _locID="70812">The Germans are as heavily armored as we are, but they outsmarted us by putting everything on wheels.</String>
		<String _locID="70813">Maybe our men of faith could learn a thing or two from the Iroquois ceremonies. They seem more ... powerful.</String>
		<String _locID="70814">Maybe Malta should have been a part of the reunification of Italy. It is looking grim for us – and I actually speak Italian!</String>
		<String _locID="70815">The healing powers of the Colombian Padre puts our order's hospitals to shame. We have a lot to learn.</String>
		<String _locID="70816">I am not ready to die just yet to the Ottoman Falcon! And I do not intend to see our knighthood broken!</String>
		<String _locID="70817">The Portuguese Organ Guns provide the thundering sound to the funeral rites. Our funeral rites.</String>
		<String _locID="70818">The Russian blockhouses encircle us like hungry birds a shoal of fish. Alas, Malta is a nice place for fishing.</String>
		<String _locID="70819">My army is out of breath! Running away from Sioux horses all day!</String>
		<String _locID="70820">I am not sure what more to be afraid of: The Spanish army or the Spanish Inquisition?</String>
		<String _locID="70821">My Infantry fears the Swedish cannons, my cavalry their pikes. We need a victory soon for morale to improve!</String>
		<String _locID="70822">I wonder how the Chinese got such a wonderful economy.</String>
		<String _locID="70823">The Japanese copied and mastered the art of island hopping – unfortunately, Malta is an island.</String>
		<String _locID="70824">The Indian tactics are treacherous. Their priests would not harm a fly, yet the very elephant they ride stomps us into submission!</String>
		<String _locID="70825">What the American Militia lacks in fighting skills they make up with numbers. And they lack a lot of skill.</String>
		<String _locID="70826">We simply did not have enough time to figure out the inner workings of the Aztec army.</String>
		<String _locID="70827">I admit, it was foolish to assume these British islanders only wanted to "construct some houses".</String>
		<String _locID="70828">The Dutch got us all into deep waters — I cannot swim in my heavy armor!</String>
		<String _locID="70829">My puny settlers had no chance against the French raids and even worse: the French Coureurs had no issue with mine!</String>
		<String _locID="70830">The Germans may receive less shipments than we do, but it is like they say: Never look a gift horse in the mouth.</String>
		<String _locID="70831">The Iroquois hatchets do not fly far, but far enough.</String>
		<String _locID="70832">My Sentinels stopped guarding our fort as soon as they spotted some Italian relatives behind their big pavise shields.</String>
		<String _locID="70833">We should have brought our boats to avoid drowning in a sea of insurgents.</String>
		<String _locID="70834">Move the crossbows to the forward walls to attack the janissaries! Defend the fort at all costs!</String>
		<String _locID="70835">If only we could have fought in a crusade with the Portuguese instead of engaging in this senseless destruction of each other!</String>
		<String _locID="70836">Another Russian Strelet for my toy soldier collection! I think I have a full set! – We can give up now!</String>
		<String _locID="70837">My spies reported that the Lakota had no houses at all, so we concluded they posed no threat. We were wrong.</String>
		<String _locID="70838">We keep shooting at the Spanish, but their Missionaries are doing God's work!</String>
		<String _locID="70839">The Swedes would eventually eat the fish my people considered inedible. There is no winning wars with gourmets!</String>
		<String _locID="70840">I was hoping to beat the Chinese into a powder as fine as the dust, but to bite the dust is what they made us do.</String>
		<String _locID="70841">Had I known how long it takes for reinforcements from Malta to arrive in Japan, I would never have agreed to this 'raid'.</String>
		<String _locID="70842">My brethren had no chance to practise fighting against Camels and Elephants on the island we live.</String>
		<String _locID="70843">It is looking grim for us. We need to sail right away before the storm breaks loose!</String>
		<String _locID="70844">Do not despair, my friend! Come, and seek shelter behind my walls to regain your strength for the last stand!</String>
		<String _locID="70845">After them! For the Order!</String>
		<String _locID="70846">With you and the Lord by my side, I have nothing to fear!</String>
		<String _locID="70847">With me by your side, you have nothing to fear!</String>
		<String _locID="70848">My Citadel is out of supplies. The walls are reduced to rubble. We must fight to the last man or offer our surrender.</String>
		<String _locID="70849">First Cyprus! Then Rhodes! Now Malta is lost, too – but we can still save our lives and sail to another island!</String>
		<String _locID="70850">We are the Knights of Saint John, we do not surrender! – We could, however, sail away.</String>
		<String _locID="70851">The enemy tries to starve us out! Quick! Attack their trade routes!</String>
		<String _locID="70852">We should make some allies among the locals. The enemy has the edge on us now.</String>
		<String _locID="70853">Ah! Very good! I assume you intend to donate your findings to my order? For the good cause.</String>
		<String _locID="70854">More treasures! An interesting source of income for my order I will continue to explore.</String>
		<String _locID="70855">You must be blessed by fate to find coin so easily. Care to show me the next spot?</String>
		<String _locID="70856">An army marches on its stomach! Keep that Explorer moving.</String>
		<String _locID="70857">More pirates! Destroy them all.</String>
		<String _locID="70858">Thou shalt not steal and love your neighbor as yourself! So says the holy book.</String>
		<String _locID="70859">I am sure there are more natives around. We should make sure we scout the entire area.</String>
		<String _locID="70860">Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy!</String>
		<String _locID="70861">Wood! It may seem plain and ordinary, but it is the source of great power. Mark my words!</String>
		<String _locID="70862">A nice cache of war supplies!</String>
		<String _locID="70863">Stolen gold – confiscated! And put to good use in the name of the Lord.</String>
		<String _locID="70864">These food supplies will keep my treasuring expeditions fed until they find an even bigger treasure.</String>
		<String _locID="70865">I had to protect this treasure – an enemy explorer had his eyes on it for too long!</String>
		<String _locID="70866">Do you know how treasuring works? It is a point and click adventure, first the guardians, then the treasure.</String>
		<String _locID="70867">I found a stranger who promised to fight for us – maybe he has a grudge with our opponents.</String>
		<String _locID="70868">A settler was lost in the woods and now was found, by me.</String>
		<String _locID="70869">Strong wood makes strong pikes.</String>
		<String _locID="70870">You can never wall yourself in too early! I will build an indestructible citadel that can withstand ten years of siege!</String>
		<String _locID="70871">Once our trade network is as well-connected as my knightly order rulers from all over, the world will obey to our will.</String>
		<String _locID="70872">Ha-ha! Time to bring out my secret demolition squad sitting behind your base!</String>
		<String _locID="70873">I would like to play a game: Trip to Jerusalem! The player without access to my trade route gets eliminated. Go!</String>
		<String _locID="70874">Racing ahead with no goal in mind will only get you lost.</String>
		<String _locID="70875">It must be a divine sign that a small knightly order puts your presumptuous "empire" to shame!</String>
		<String _locID="70876">Hanging in old ages for nostalgia will not win wars. Even our oldest knights know how to fire a musket by now.</String>
		<String _locID="70877">Rushing ahead gives you little without the resources to capitalize on it.</String>
		<String _locID="70878">What were you still looking for in the previous age? Courage? Chivalry? Power? We already took all of it.</String>
		<String _locID="70879">No amount of gold is enough to weigh up your sins. That is why I should take that gold.</String>
		<String _locID="70880">Chivalry is dead, which means that I am the last proper knight in this battle.</String>
		<String _locID="70881">Tell me, however unlikely that is, have you ever heard of the Circle of Ossus?</String>
		<String _locID="70882">If you win this I might consider inviting you to one of my many secret organizations.</String>
		<String _locID="70883">Last time was a good warmup, this time do not pull any punches!</String>
		<String _locID="70884">I have been to this place before. You could call it a Déjà-vu.</String>
		<String _locID="70885">You have chosen... poorly.</String>
		<String _locID="70886">Your eyes are full of fire. On your head, too many crowns. Yet you will cry out for help—there will be no one to save you.</String>
		<String _locID="70887">What is your untalented explorer trying to find in my base? The fountain of youth? Is he not a bit too old for that?</String>
		<String _locID="70888">Your ragtag band of bandits does not scare me.</String>
		<String _locID="70889">Your blades are as dull as your men.</String>
		<String _locID="70890">You come not to bring peace, but to bring the sword. Now let us see how blades fare against stone walls!</String>
		<String _locID="70891">Do you see those walls? My order can hold out until reinforcements arrive.</String>
		<String _locID="70892">You gained no honor from this victory, only a small island.</String>
		<String _locID="70893">Are you always picking on someone smaller than yourself?</String>
		<String _locID="70894">Be careful now, I know where you live.</String>
		<String _locID="70895">All quiet on the front today. Do you maybe want to attempt a siege tomorrow? I would like to test some new explosives.</String>
		<String _locID="70896">The ancient ruins of Malta hold secrets many have tried to uncover.</String>
		<String _locID="70897">Your show of force has left a lasting impression on my troops. Would you like to challenge me for the role of Grand Inquisitor?</String>
		<String _locID="70898">An honorable loss against a worthy opponent. Shall we end all hostilities now?</String>
		<String _locID="70899">My trade! I will tear your economy apart for this!</String>
		<String _locID="70900">Do not get too fond of your find, I will destroy whatever you use it on.</String>
		<String _locID="70901">I have more important matters to attend to. Keep that treasure.</String>
		<String _locID="70902">All these coins you gather will be confiscated by my brethren – sooner or later.</String>
		<String _locID="70903">That food pales in comparison to what my fishermen are bringing in every minute.</String>
		<String _locID="70904">Hoard all treasures like a dragon, you will still be slain by this knight.</String>
		<String _locID="70905">You use your actions on treasures, I use them on the preparation of your demise.</String>
		<String _locID="70906">Such brazen disrespect to the property of a knight will not be accepted!</String>
		<String _locID="70907">I did not want him to join my forces anyways, he would only slow my men down.</String>
		<String _locID="70908">Release those prisoners!</String>
		<String _locID="70909">Build all you want with it, our ingenious engineers invented plenty of ways to set things aflame!</String>
		<String _locID="70910">Your bulwark of cowardice will not stand. No crack, no gap in your wall goes unnoticed by legendary defenders like us!</String>
		<String _locID="70911">I have met an order of independent warriors and we saw that our interests align, your destruction.</String>
		<String _locID="70912">Come to my trading post! I trade bible quotes for coin. It is a unique experience.</String>
		<String _locID="70913">The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.</String>
		<String _locID="70914">Even a Templar is more motivated if he also fights for a good sum of gold.</String>
		<String _locID="70915">This field ration will keep my brothers healthy and full of energy!</String>
		<String _locID="70916">If you wanted it, you should have sent your explorer to get it.</String>
		<String _locID="70917">Do not worry about treasures, I almost got them all by now.</String>
		<String _locID="70918">A new member for our Order!</String>
		<String _locID="70919">No amount of gold is enough to weigh up your sins.</String>
		<String _locID="70920">Not on my watch, my friend. Not on my watch!</String>
		<String _locID="70921">This monopoly will be the final nail in the coffin of your empire!</String>
		<String _locID="70930">Gather your strength, our people must break the monopoly!</String>
		<String _locID="70931">Soon we will have the victory our people deserve, without the violence that usually accompanies it.</String>
		<String _locID="70932">Yes my friend.</String>
		<String _locID="70933">Action must be taken at once; there is no time to be lost!</String>
		<String _locID="70934">We are preparing to move the cannons. These models are a bit older, you see.</String>
		<String _locID="70935">Our fine horses will crush the oppressors!</String>
		<String _locID="70936">My footmen are in a frenzy, thirsting for a good fight!</String>
		<String _locID="70937">Our people have been robbed for generations! We cannot afford to help you at this time.</String>
		<String _locID="70938">Not now, my friend. You see, it's siesta.</String>
		<String _locID="70939">I must recruit more revolutionaries first.</String>
		<String _locID="70940">I am sorry, I could not square my conscience with this.</String>
		<String _locID="70941">The Colombian army is still growing. I cannot send it into battle quite yet.</String>
		<String _locID="70942">The enemy will not let us win without a fight. Let us show them justice!</String>
		<String _locID="70943">We could have fought united with the United States of America against European influence, instead of fighting each other.</String>
		<String _locID="70944">Many native tribes have joined Gran Colombia. The Aztecs can join as well.</String>
		<String _locID="70945">The British cannot even control their own colonies. What did they expect to happen against us?</String>
		<String _locID="70946">The Dutch make much more formidable allies than enemies.</String>
		<String _locID="70947">We will make the French regret ever meddling in our affairs!</String>
		<String _locID="70948">The German states might find themselves at a crossroads after this.</String>
		<String _locID="70949">The Iroquois nations are strongest when they work together. Perhaps today they had a disagreement.</String>
		<String _locID="70950">The Ottomans should have steered clear of South America. The climate is not what they're accustomed to.</String>
		<String _locID="70951">The Portuguese should have listened to the Pope. This is not their land.</String>
		<String _locID="70952">The Russians had their chance in America and sold it. Perhaps they don't value victory as much.</String>
		<String _locID="70953">The Sioux were worthy opponents, but it is now time to stop the bloodshed.</String>
		<String _locID="70954">When tyranny becomes law, rebellion is a right. The Spaniards have learned that today.</String>
		<String _locID="70955">The Swedish king loses his temper too easily. If he kept a cool head like me, he may have had a chance.</String>
		<String _locID="70956">The Italians could have made formidable trading partners. Now, they will be formidable vassals.</String>
		<String _locID="70957">Do the Maltese wish to discuss their surrender with us?</String>
		<String _locID="70958">Before long, the Chinese consulate will host a fine feast for our ambassadors to sign their terms of surrender.</String>
		<String _locID="70959">No amount of isolation will help Japan now.</String>
		<String _locID="70960">I am empathetic of the Indian cause against European empires, but I will not allow them to stand in our way.</String>
		<String _locID="70961">The American forces are saber-rattling on our borders. We must form a united front against them!</String>
		<String _locID="70962">The Aztec Empire has recovered and is about to reclaim dominance!</String>
		<String _locID="70963">I see houses lining the horizon - a frightful sight when fighting the British.</String>
		<String _locID="70964">These Dutch Ruyters are a greater plague than mosquitoes! And they can't be banished with smoke, either.</String>
		<String _locID="70965">A rumble in the distance! France must be parading its cavalry again.</String>
		<String _locID="70966">Another shipment for the German economy means another Uhlan in our economy, wreaking havoc.</String>
		<String _locID="70967">The sun shines on the expanding Iroquois lands. That is why they always see us coming.</String>
		<String _locID="70968">We lie on opposite ends of the Spanish sphere of influence, but with no Spaniards to fight, the Ottomans must be building their army to fight us next!</String>
		<String _locID="70969">I would attack the Portuguese, but everywhere my men raid, they run into another of their town centers.</String>
		<String _locID="70970">The Russian Empire is coming! Grab your sarape and prepare for a long winter.</String>
		<String _locID="70971">My men feel ill-equipped to fend off the growing Sioux threat. And the trade negotiations from our envoys were also turned down.</String>
		<String _locID="70972">Our Spanish oppressors are trying to gain control. We should drive them from our land, once and for all!</String>
		<String _locID="70973">These Swedes are putting up quite a fight against our Guerrilleros. Have your machete ready at hand to fend off their charges!</String>
		<String _locID="70974">The Italians control almost everything around us. We should disrupt their economy!</String>
		<String _locID="70975">The Maltese knights will mercilessly ravage our lands if we do not push back with faith, blood and iron.</String>
		<String _locID="70976">The Chinese Empire is growing strong!</String>
		<String _locID="70977">At least Japan sees us as an equal nation, but not in a friendly way, I'm afraid.</String>
		<String _locID="70978">I hear entire forests falling in the distance. India must be expanding its economy.</String>
		<String _locID="70979">I hope that you can share some benefits from the next age with us.</String>
		<String _locID="70980">A wise decision.</String>
		<String _locID="70981">Knowledge is power my friend, consider advancing with your town center soon.</String>
		<String _locID="70982">Are you rushing the enemy? Do not worry, I will secure our technological advantage in the meantime.</String>
		<String _locID="70983">You do not yet have wings and already want to fly.</String>
		<String _locID="70984">Welcome to the path of progress.</String>
		<String _locID="70985">Let us surrender and live, lest our people be doomed.</String>
		<String _locID="70986">The enemy is at my gates, send reinforcements!</String>
		<String _locID="70987">Hello there. Are you Amelia Black's friend? I have heard a lot about you. How is she doing these days?</String>
		<String _locID="70988">I do not take lightly the responsibility that my people have entrusted me with.</String>
		<String _locID="70989">Another day, another foe that wants to bring down our nations.</String>
		<String _locID="70990">I have learned to make the right alliances after my last defeat.</String>
		<String _locID="70991">With you by my side, we have nothing to fear.</String>
		<String _locID="70992">The art of victory is learned in defeat.</String>
		<String _locID="70993">Have you learned from our last endeavor?</String>
		<String _locID="70994">To do something right, it must be done twice. The first time instructs the second.</String>
		<String _locID="70995">Will the fighting in these lands never cease?</String>
		<String _locID="70996">No playing around this time! Bring everything that you have! Machetes, plows, staffs...</String>
		<String _locID="70997">Nothing can go wrong fighting for a righteous cause.</String>
		<String _locID="70998">My General fell into enemy hands. I had to pay an absurd sum, but he will be worth it!</String>
		<String _locID="70999">Our silver mines have made my people rich… and now you as well.</String>
		<String _locID="71000">Now that we are no longer robbed by excessive taxation, we can share some coin with you.</String>
		<String _locID="71001">An army marches on its stomach.</String>
		<String _locID="71002">My people gathered an excess of food, we will let you have some of it.</String>
		<String _locID="71003">A shipment of wood from my homeland recently arrived. I have sent you some of it.</String>
		<String _locID="71004">I recently taught my villagers to use a new type of saw. If you need more wood in the future, research it at the market as well.</String>
		<String _locID="71005">We must bring the enemy to their knees. I will attack their base at once!</String>
		<String _locID="71006">My Soldados are eager to reclaim this town in our name!</String>
		<String _locID="71007">Let us free the natives from their oppression!</String>
		<String _locID="71008">Their trade is their weakness. I will strike now and cut them off from any future shipments.</String>
		<String _locID="71009">We shall yet see the oppressors' yoke broken and the fragments scattered on the ground.</String>
		<String _locID="71010">This will be a fine place to construct a new base.</String>
		<String _locID="71011">Will you join the celebration for my new Town Center?</String>
		<String _locID="71012">Our Plantations are overproducing. Here! We want to share the profits with a good friend.</String>
		<String _locID="71013">Our stores are bursting with food! Of course we will share it with our allies.</String>
		<String _locID="71014">I do not know what to do with all this wood, would you take some off our hands?</String>
		<String _locID="71015">My army is restless. If you need a hand, we will help you defend.</String>
		<String _locID="71016">Every day that we rest, we are not bringing justice to the enemy!</String>
		<String _locID="71017">A people that loves freedom will in the end be free.</String>
		<String _locID="71018">I will wage war on the invaders if you send coin!</String>
		<String _locID="71019">My army is hungry and our stockpiles are low. Would you mind sending us something?</String>
		<String _locID="71020">I need more wood to finish the Cathedral. Can you spare some?</String>
		<String _locID="71021">Thank you! I will invest this coin wisely for the good cause.</String>
		<String _locID="71022">With your help, my men will no longer fight on an empty stomach.</String>
		<String _locID="71023">You have my eternal gratitude.</String>
		<String _locID="71024">A divided nation will be easily conquered by the Americans. I must rally my men!</String>
		<String _locID="71025">The Aztec Skull Knights are a terrifying sight!</String>
		<String _locID="71026">The British are preparing a fierce attack on our lands. They think that we owe them something.</String>
		<String _locID="71027">The firepower of the Dutch army is so pervasive that it turned the sky dark.</String>
		<String _locID="71028">The hooves of the French horses will bring us before our maker, if we do not act soon.</String>
		<String _locID="71029">My Soldados report that they fail to pierce through the sturdy German war wagons with their lances and bayonets.</String>
		<String _locID="71030">The Iroquois are expanding their territory, pillaging our villages!</String>
		<String _locID="71031">The Ottomans were lucky to have contructed their bombards earlier. I was still missing wheels for the mortars.</String>
		<String _locID="71032">We are out of resources. The Portuguese Empire has claimed everything. As usual.</String>
		<String _locID="71033">With a never-ending stream of Strelets on the front line and a swarm of Oprichniks in our town, fate has abandoned us.</String>
		<String _locID="71034">The Sioux are too fast even for our best cavalry. How are we supposed to catch up with them?</String>
		<String _locID="71035">We might not rid ourselves from the shackles of Spanish oppression today.</String>
		<String _locID="71036">Even without their cannons, I expect the Swedes to run in guns blazing any time now.</String>
		<String _locID="71037">The sailors in Rome are dancing to celebrate our demise.</String>
		<String _locID="71038">Maltese knights are brave, but let us show them what we are capable of when we are cornered!</String>
		<String _locID="71039">These Chinese rockets hurt even more than the sting of a habanero pepper. Have you ever tried one?</String>
		<String _locID="71040">If Japan was not so shy with other nations, this could have been the start of a nice friendly treaty.</String>
		<String _locID="71041">The Indian elephants are stomping us into submission. If we lose this, my people will be no better off than before!</String>
		<String _locID="71042">The Americans are expanding south to add to their union. Let's hope our borders never meet.</String>
		<String _locID="71043">The Aztec Empire might survive another day, but it cannot avoid the inevitable.</String>
		<String _locID="71044">These British are like a tiny dog. All bark, no bite.</String>
		<String _locID="71045">My settlers wear the same rags as the Dutch, but their banks are still bringing in great profit.</String>
		<String _locID="71046">We all have a tough time, but these Coureurs des Bois are a hardy bunch.</String>
		<String _locID="71047">Those Germans might not have the most advanced army, but they sure are advancing.</String>
		<String _locID="71048">The Iroquois are building a new longhouse, preparing more space in which to imprison us.</String>
		<String _locID="71049">The Ottomans cannot afford many cannons, but even in low numbers they sure pack a punch!</String>
		<String _locID="71050">We can hold back their army, but even Portuguese town centers are conquering the land.</String>
		<String _locID="71051">I did not think it possible that there ever could be more Strelets than Guerrilleros, but it happened!</String>
		<String _locID="71052">Sioux raiders have turned our countryside into no man's land. Not even the bandidos want it.</String>
		<String _locID="71053">Spanish oppression may last another decade, but my children will rise again, even if we lose today.</String>
		<String _locID="71054">The Swedes took control of the map faster than expected! It will not happen again!</String>
		<String _locID="71055">We could have had great trading relations with the Italians, but instead they doomed us both.</String>
		<String _locID="71056">How did we end up fighting the Knights of Saint John? This was a terrible mistake for both of us.</String>
		<String _locID="71057">The Chinese are experts with gunpowder, but it seems that they are not bad with classic warfare either.</String>
		<String _locID="71058">What a pity. I wanted to send a scientific mission to Japan, but we do not seem to be welcome right now. Also, I have no scientists left.</String>
		<String _locID="71059">This sepoy uprising is defeating our peasant uprising. Now everyone's lands are ruined.</String>
		<String _locID="71060">You need to pull us out of this sinkhole, old friend.</String>
		<String _locID="71061">It is looking so bad for us, I feel the urge to visit my Cathedral and confess my sins to a padre.</String>
		<String _locID="71062">We have the momentum, but should we overstay our welcome?</String>
		<String _locID="71063">Your ferocity is an inspiration to our team!</String>
		<String _locID="71064">Keep your spirits up, friend! I will hold them off, then you deliver the finishing blow.</String>
		<String _locID="71065">My people have lost their faith and their hope. We are fighting for a lost cause.</String>
		<String _locID="71066">My dreams for a united Gran Colombia are shattered. My friend, let us surrender before our civilians are slaughtered for our pride.</String>
		<String _locID="71067">I would say that things look desperate for us, but I genuinely do not want to be mistaken for a desperado.</String>
		<String _locID="71068">The enemy is afraid of the Colombian army! Let us make them confront their fears!</String>
		<String _locID="71069">It is always good to be on friendly terms with the local population.</String>
		<String _locID="71070">You beat me to this one, my friend.</String>
		<String _locID="71071">Good catch, but do not let the bandidos see you!</String>
		<String _locID="71072">That treasure will fetch a fine price.</String>
		<String _locID="71073">You should use that food to feed your people.</String>
		<String _locID="71074">Do not forget to use those treasures for an army, they are more than fancy trinkets!</String>
		<String _locID="71075">I prefer that you look outside my base for future endeavours.</String>
		<String _locID="71076">The people of these lands know more than you think. Use their skills wisely!</String>
		<String _locID="71077">It never hurts to have more help.</String>
		<String _locID="71078">What will it be, a weapon for your army, or a house for your settlers?</String>
		<String _locID="71079">I have claimed a treasure! This will help us in our plans.</String>
		<String _locID="71080">I found a centavo! Let us hope that it brings us luck!</String>
		<String _locID="71081">Only he who is not hungry says the coconut has a hard shell.</String>
		<String _locID="71082">Do not worry, friend. I will pay you back with interest, by winning our battles.</String>
		<String _locID="71083">There are enough treasures for both of us, my friend. I know a few spots where some conquistadores died with their stolen gold.</String>
		<String _locID="71084">This local guide will provide important knowledge of the map.</String>
		<String _locID="71085">A lost soul was found, happy to help our cause!</String>
		<String _locID="71086">Someone cut firewood, but never got around to lighting it.</String>
		<String _locID="71087">These walls will protect our people while we plan our offensive.</String>
		<String _locID="71088">The combined power of our cultures will bring them to their knees!</String>
		<String _locID="71089">We have been waiting to raid your revenue. I think that the time has come.</String>
		<String _locID="71090">How can this cowardice be rewarded? Come and face me on the battlefield!</String>
		<String _locID="71091">Morals and lights are our first necessities.</String>
		<String _locID="71092">Do not compare your material forces with those of the enemy. Spirit cannot be compared with matter. You are human beings, they are beasts. You are free, they are slaves.</String>
		<String _locID="71093">The first duty of a government is to give education to the people.</String>
		<String _locID="71094">Your technological prowess will not help you against the wrath of my Guerrilleros!</String>
		<String _locID="71095">Now that we are on more equal footing, let us have a fair fight. I will send my first Soldado.</String>
		<String _locID="71096">You are late! Was your siesta maybe a little too long?</String>
		<String _locID="71097">Trying to hide from everyone? Our Guerrilleros have been watching you the whole time.</String>
		<String _locID="71098">Living so close to my ally is not wise. I will always defend my dear friends!</String>
		<String _locID="71099">Your monopoly, our boycott.</String>
		<String _locID="71100">I am Simon Bolivar, El Libertador. What are you doing here? Are you with the Spanish?</String>
		<String _locID="71101">Appearances are deceiving. God grants victory to perseverance.</String>
		<String _locID="71102">There is an even easier way out of this - just surrender and become part of Gran Colombia.</String>
		<String _locID="71103">A tree born twisted will never straighten its branches. Just like you never change the map!</String>
		<String _locID="71104">Your alliance does not scare me, for I have fate itself on my side.</String>
		<String _locID="71105">You might think yourself safe this time, but all injustice will be punished, no matter the odds!</String>
		<String _locID="71106">I hereby expel your explorer from my lands. Return, and you will face punishment without mercy!</String>
		<String _locID="71107">Oh, how cute. Is that your army, or a Mariachi band?</String>
		<String _locID="71108">Are you here for a visit? Have a look around, we are a very welcoming people.</String>
		<String _locID="71109">Your army is dwarfed by the count of my villagers alone. Do not expect them to just surrender.</String>
		<String _locID="71110">My base is prepared, are you?</String>
		<String _locID="71111">You can take our buildings, but you will never take our freedom!</String>
		<String _locID="71112">Your men might not fit into my base, at least not in one piece.</String>
		<String _locID="71113">So, that pompous palace is your Town Center? How revolting.</String>
		<String _locID="71114">It is harder to release a nation from servitude than to enslave a free nation.</String>
		<String _locID="71115">Flee the country where a lone man holds all power: It is a nation of slaves.</String>
		<String _locID="71116">Though I may die, I shall be remembered forever. You all will soon be forgotten.</String>
		<String _locID="71117">I must admit, my defeat is the price that I will pay, for peace for my people.</String>
		<String _locID="71118">You may think yourself wise, but this trading post was the only thing between you and my insurgent followers.</String>
		<String _locID="71119">Do you really want to crawl through the dirt for those few resources?</String>
		<String _locID="71120">Who did you have to murder to gather this token of injustice?</String>
		<String _locID="71121">All the gold in the world will not be enough to save you from our wrath!</String>
		<String _locID="71122">Are you even eating off the ground now? May that food keep you alive a little longer.</String>
		<String _locID="71123">Your people cannot produce enough to satisfy your hunger? You truly are a desperado.</String>
		<String _locID="71124">Your greed will come back to haunt you, mark my words!</String>
		<String _locID="71125">Stealing from me? I will ask some bandidos to get it back.</String>
		<String _locID="71126">This native warrior will only lead you to meet your demise faster.</String>
		<String _locID="71127">Forcing peasants to work for you? Keep it up -- because of such treatment, the Colombian people became independent.</String>
		<String _locID="71128">What will you steal next?</String>
		<String _locID="71129">You build more walls, but my people have already faced far greater hardships than that.</String>
		<String _locID="71130">I will teach the locals and in return, they will teach me.</String>
		<String _locID="71131">God helps he who rises early.</String>
		<String _locID="71132">You do not check the teeth of a free horse.</String>
		<String _locID="71133">The riches of this land do not belong to you, they belong to the people, my people.</String>
		<String _locID="71134">Ah good! I haven't had breakfast yet.</String>
		<String _locID="71135">I was only bringing this treasure to its rightful owner – the people of this land – before the invader, you, could take it!</String>
		<String _locID="71136">My supporters in the countryside left another cache of resources for me.</String>
		<String _locID="71137">More locals join the rebellion against you!</String>
		<String _locID="71138">Another helping hand for the Colombian economy!</String>
		<String _locID="71139">Settlers are still flocking to my righteous cause.</String>
		<String _locID="71140">This wood comes in handy. What will I build with it? A Cathedral? A Fort? Or weapons to beat you with?</String>
		<String _locID="71141">Try to appease them all you want, but they will always prefer joining Gran Colombia over being ruled by you.</String>
		<String _locID="71142">A trading post? My fellow men have already burned down more impressive buildings.</String>
		<String _locID="71143">A monopoly? My people will not be oppressed, militarily or economically!</String>
		<String _locID="71144">Your control over the trade routes is over. Admit defeat and avoid further bloodshed!</String>
		<String _locID="71155">Send word across our empires--we must enlist anyone old enough to hold a weapon! We cannot allow such a pitiful victory!</String>
		<String _locID="71156">It's the final countdown!</String>
		<String _locID="71157">I agree.</String>
		<String _locID="71158">This was already part of my plan.</String>
		<String _locID="71159">You want me to train more artillery? I invented artillery!</String>
		<String _locID="71160">Of course. Everyone fears the charge of my cavalry!</String>
		<String _locID="71161">I see that your troops are stuck. Don't worry! My elite infantry will bail them out.</String>
		<String _locID="71162">I do not wish to pay tribute at this time.</String>
		<String _locID="71163">Sorry, what did you say? My new cannons are so loud!</String>
		<String _locID="71164">Winter has been hard on my troops. You must wait before we can fight again.</String>
		<String _locID="71165">What you are asking is simply impossible!</String>
		<String _locID="71166">I need time to muster my troops.</String>
		<String _locID="71167">Our Trading Posts have been destroyed! How can we acquire saffron now?</String>
		<String _locID="71168">What is sweeter than Aztec chocolate? The smell of victory!</String>
		<String _locID="71169">These British will not rule our icy seas!</String>
		<String _locID="71170">These Dutch have no idea how to prepare a good herring, and it will lead to their defeat!</String>
		<String _locID="71171">These French are ready to meet their Waterloo today.</String>
		<String _locID="71172">The Germans sold us their soldiers; now we're beating them with their own men!</String>
		<String _locID="71173">These Ottomans could not keep their gunpowder dry, and that has led to their downfall.</String>
		<String _locID="71174">The shipbuilding techniques of the Portuguese will not save them now.</String>
		<String _locID="71175">Who fears the Russians? I am the king in the north!</String>
		<String _locID="71176">How do you break the Spanish Tercio? - With a cannonball! Ha-ha-ha!</String>
		<String _locID="71177">The Chinese invented gunpowder, and I showed them how to use it.</String>
		<String _locID="71178">The Japanese didn't shy away from a fight, but their honor could not save them from superior weaponry!</String>
		<String _locID="71179">No Indian elephant is too big for my cannons!</String>
		<String _locID="71180">The Aztec Jaguar warriors with their obsidian blades are worthy foes for my lion-hearted soldiers!</String>
		<String _locID="71181">The British have built a professional army and expanded their arsenal. Time to launch an attack!</String>
		<String _locID="71182">It's getting serious. The Dutch sold all of their tulips to field more cannons than I can.</String>
		<String _locID="71183">The armor of the French cuirassiers gleams in the sun. I shall respond with the light of my cannons!</String>
		<String _locID="71184">The Germans must have untold riches to muster such a big army. We should sack their towns!</String>
		<String _locID="71185">The Ottoman artillery is loud and numerous, but my gunners can also hit their targets!</String>
		<String _locID="71186">The Portuguese outmaneuver us and know how to keep our troops at bay.</String>
		<String _locID="71187">The Russians have reformed their army and hold numerical superiority. Follow my lead!</String>
		<String _locID="71188">The Spanish deploy their forces with excellence, but can they compete with mine?</String>
		<String _locID="71189">The mighty Chinese army is upgrading its weaponry. Let us attack now or they will tip the odds in their favor!</String>
		<String _locID="71190">The Japanese Samurai are carving their way through our ranks with their sharp katanas. Impressive.</String>
		<String _locID="71191">Cannons on elephants, sword whips and blade arms. The Indians are trying to outsmart us!</String>
		<String _locID="71192">Uh... I'm right behind you! It won't be long...</String>
		<String _locID="71193">Already? Tell me, how do you manage to develop so quickly?</String>
		<String _locID="71194">Don't stay in the first age. Marvelous technologies await us!</String>
		<String _locID="71195">You must advance to the next age! Technological advancements will lead to our victory!</String>
		<String _locID="71196">Be careful. If your economic production does not grow, nor will your military.</String>
		<String _locID="71197">Finally, now we can get started.</String>
		<String _locID="71198">This battle is not in my interest, I shall focus my attention elsewhere in my empire.</String>
		<String _locID="71199">My camp is under attack! I request your aid so that I can turn this tide!</String>
		<String _locID="71200">My name is Gustavus Adolphus. I am destined for greatness!</String>
		<String _locID="71201">If you send me your battle plans I can make adjustments that will bring us victory!</String>
		<String _locID="71202">A higher difficulty this time? I see that you are finally rising to my level!</String>
		<String _locID="71203">Don't think I'll go easy on them just because you lowered the difficulty setting!</String>
		<String _locID="71204">Your ferocity is comparable to mine. Let us both overwhelm our enemies with it!</String>
		<String _locID="71205">I am grateful to have you by my side again.</String>
		<String _locID="71206">I'm glad you understand the value of having me as an ally, rather than as an enemy.</String>
		<String _locID="71207">Just give me a shout when you need my help again.</String>
		<String _locID="71208">We know this map well, my friend. An excellent advantage.</String>
		<String _locID="71209">It wasn't my fault that we lost last time. I trust you're done warming up?</String>
		<String _locID="71210">We are a dream team. Let us march all away across the land!</String>
		<String _locID="71211">I was forced to pay ransom for my explorer. Such a fall from grace from our proud past...</String>
		<String _locID="71212">Consider this a partial repayment of those... ancient debts I owe you.</String>
		<String _locID="71213">Your coffers are awkwardly empty.</String>
		<String _locID="71214">The cod catch was great this year. Here, share it with me.</String>
		<String _locID="71215">In Sweden we season our food with nothing but salt, but we do have lots of it! Here, have some.</String>
		<String _locID="71216">My forests are vast and my lumberjacks very efficient. You can have this wood, as a token of our friendship.</String>
		<String _locID="71217">With this timber you just might construct an empire as vast as mine!</String>
		<String _locID="71218">If we wait much longer, we will lose the advantage of surprise. I must march to battle!</String>
		<String _locID="71219">We will win this war by always making the first move. March, men!</String>
		<String _locID="71220">I will crush these natives the same way that I crushed the Snapphanes!</String>
		<String _locID="71221">Let's see if your invisible hand can stop me from plundering your trade!</String>
		<String _locID="71222">With God and the victorious arms, we shall win this fight!</String>
		<String _locID="71223">My army needs room to expand. I shall build another military base.</String>
		<String _locID="71224">I shall found a new city for the Swedish Empire!</String>
		<String _locID="71225">Take this coin. You seem like you need it.</String>
		<String _locID="71226">Do you like fish? I can throw you a red herring.</String>
		<String _locID="71227">We'll send you some of our finest lumber!</String>
		<String _locID="71228">If an ally is in need, Sweden will answer!</String>
		<String _locID="71229">I do not do well in peacetime... perhaps we could start just a tiny war?</String>
		<String _locID="71230">All of this inaction is making my troops anxious.</String>
		<String _locID="71231">My population is too small to support my giant army. Could you spare me some coin?</String>
		<String _locID="71232">Winter has been harsh in Sweden. Could you spare us some food?</String>
		<String _locID="71233">I used my last wood to build a giant goat and someone burned it down. Could you spare me some of yours?</String>
		<String _locID="71234">We'll spend the coin wisely on our technological advancement.</String>
		<String _locID="71235">It's no pickled herring, but it will have to do.</String>
		<String _locID="71236">We'll craft masterful constructions with your wood. Many thanks.</String>
		<String _locID="71237">The Aztecs are dominating the battlefield. Today, I have sacrified my honor.</String>
		<String _locID="71238">The British have defeated us! We shall not be ruling the waves today.</String>
		<String _locID="71239">The Dutch have come to pillage my settlement... again!</String>
		<String _locID="71240">I did not expect such fierceness from the French. Today, I shall surrender.</String>
		<String _locID="71241">The Germans are furious. Are they still upset about Magdeburg - or is it my name?</String>
		<String _locID="71242">I cannot believe that the Ottomans are running us off... again!</String>
		<String _locID="71243">I do not want to become lost in the smoke from the Portuguese cannons. We should pull back.</String>
		<String _locID="71244">The Russian army is too big for a pitched battle. We should retreat to fight another day.</String>
		<String _locID="71245">The Spanish came for our gold, but we spent it all on this lost war! We should surrender.</String>
		<String _locID="71246">Let the Chinese be the central kingdom so long as we can keep the north.</String>
		<String _locID="71247">United under one banner and with all of their swords facing us, the Japanese fighting prowess is too much to handle.</String>
		<String _locID="71248">Camelry and elephants trample my horses... why did I decide to pick a fight with the Indians?</String>
		<String _locID="71249">Let us negotiate a truce with the Aztecs, so my botanists can at least take a good look at their floating gardens.</String>
		<String _locID="71250">The British are still using archers on the battlefield? It seems that I underestimated this ancient weaponry.</String>
		<String _locID="71251">These Dutch took all of our fish! No wonder we have been defeated.</String>
		<String _locID="71252">We are no match for the mighty French. An alliance will be in our interests for the next war.</String>
		<String _locID="71253">The Germans noticed that the Schwedentrunk doesn't taste like beer. We should break camp - now!</String>
		<String _locID="71254">It appears that the Ottomans brought guns of their own. Who would have thought?</String>
		<String _locID="71255">The Portuguese opened fire before my cannons were in position. Retreat!</String>
		<String _locID="71256">These Russians brought guns to a snowball fight. No wonder we lost.</String>
		<String _locID="71257">My soldiers underestimated the length of Spanish pikes. Now victory is literally out of reach.</String>
		<String _locID="71258">I hate to admit it, but the inventions of the Chinese leave me stumped. How can I fight against this?</String>
		<String _locID="71259">I figured that the Japanese would be too busy fighting among themselves to oppose us, but it seems that I was mistaken.</String>
		<String _locID="71260">The Indians fight like tigers, and we just became their prey.</String>
		<String _locID="71261">It is time for me to fade away. I have lost the game, and no one is to blame... here I go!</String>
		<String _locID="71262">We are in the worst game, we are in last place, and you are the worst part of this team. Do you know how bad that makes you!?</String>
		<String _locID="71263">My men march with ferocity! Our victory is ensured!</String>
		<String _locID="71264">You are tough as leather! You have proven to be a worthy ally to Sweden!</String>
		<String _locID="71265">The Lion of the North roars again! You are honoured to have me by your side.</String>
		<String _locID="71266">Today we were outsmarted! Let us resign and fight again another day.</String>
		<String _locID="71267">A good general recognizes when the battle is lost. Let us resign with honor.</String>
		<String _locID="71268">I am longing to go back to Stockholm. Can we stop this bloodshed?</String>
		<String _locID="71269">Our enemy lives a life of wealth through trade. If we let them continue like this, it will put my treasury to shame.</String>
		<String _locID="71270">Many of the natives have been rallied to oppose us. Such auxiliaries benefit our enemy far too well.</String>
		<String _locID="71271">I hope that we can find many treasures in this new world.</String>
		<String _locID="71272">A decent find.</String>
		<String _locID="71273">Is that the most exotic find that this place has to offer?</String>
		<String _locID="71274">Spend that food wisely. An army cannot march on an empty stomach!</String>
		<String _locID="71275">Don't tell me that you will be ignoring the war to pursue your treasure hunting obsession?</String>
		<String _locID="71276">That discovery was in my territory! Keep to your own lands!</String>
		<String _locID="71277">You may recruit help from the locals if you so wish.</String>
		<String _locID="71278">A passable demonstration of kindness. At least you made the settlers happy.</String>
		<String _locID="71279">As exotic that wood might be, will the houses you build with them be as beautiful as mine?</String>
		<String _locID="71280">I have claimed a treasure! Soon, my future vision will be reality.</String>
		<String _locID="71281">As soon as these coins are polished, they will be fit for my coffers!</String>
		<String _locID="71282">Enough food for seconds at my banquet!</String>
		<String _locID="71283">I figured that you were not interested in keeping that for yourself.</String>
		<String _locID="71284">I'm quite enjoying this treasure hunt.</String>
		<String _locID="71285">An extra pair of helping hands from those who know the land better than us.</String>
		<String _locID="71286">My daring expedition to rescue these settlers was a success!</String>
		<String _locID="71287">I wonder how many Dalecarlian horses I can carve with this wood?</String>
		<String _locID="71288">I did not build this wall because I cannot stand the outside world. I just need a break from it.</String>
		<String _locID="71289">Wealth is imminent! Tonight we shall feast as our forefathers did.</String>
		<String _locID="71290">So, you have chosen the coward's way to to victory? It will cost you dearly!</String>
		<String _locID="71291">A king, warlord, and businessman. That's me!</String>
		<String _locID="71292">You may have new tools at hand, but do you have anyone to use them?</String>
		<String _locID="71293">You... do know how to age up, right?</String>
		<String _locID="71294">Are you still an age behind? Your mother would be so ashamed of you!</String>
		<String _locID="71295">You have advanced to the next age? We will be there shortly and outshine your technological advances!</String>
		<String _locID="71296">Well, you can't place first every time... or ever, in your case.</String>
		<String _locID="71297">Aaaand in last place we have... you! Congratulations!</String>
		<String _locID="71298">Are you building a vacation cabin for yourself over there?</String>
		<String _locID="71299">I could not imagine wanting to live so close to your neighbor.</String>
		<String _locID="71300">The trade must flow!</String>
		<String _locID="71301">I am Gustavus Adolphus, the Lion of the North. Today you will hear me roar!</String>
		<String _locID="71302">You think that last time was hard? It was a mere military exercise!</String>
		<String _locID="71303">You think that this will be easier? War is never easy!</String>
		<String _locID="71304">I recognize this part of the woods! I used to defeat my foes here.</String>
		<String _locID="71305">The Swedish Empire is small, yet you bring all of these allies? We shall meet on the battlefield!</String>
		<String _locID="71306">Through my guidance, my alliance will crush your empire!</String>
		<String _locID="71307">You come to look for a king?</String>
		<String _locID="71308">I see that you have assembled your army. Maybe you can pick off a moose or two with it.</String>
		<String _locID="71309">What is your retinue doing here? Oh, is this your army? Could have fooled me.</String>
		<String _locID="71310">Aahh! My cannonballs will turn your army into meatballs!</String>
		<String _locID="71311">I have faced far worse odds than this!</String>
		<String _locID="71312">My base is going up in flames like my beloved Vasa! Vengeance will be mine!</String>
		<String _locID="71313">This is the force that you send to fight the Swedish Empire? You insult me!</String>
		<String _locID="71314">This is your base? How very... quaint.</String>
		<String _locID="71315">This is quite nice, don't you think? Why don't you delete those troops of yours? Surely you don't need them in such... peaceful times?</String>
		<String _locID="71316">We shall fight again another day, but for now, I request to resign.</String>
		<String _locID="71317">A great general recognizes defeat. May I offer my surrender?</String>
		<String _locID="71318">Just a minor dent in my plan.</String>
		<String _locID="71319">Oh, you found your first treasure. How cute.</String>
		<String _locID="71320">Keep scouting for knick-knacks. They won't help you against my mighty army!</String>
		<String _locID="71321">You found some gold? It's worth nothing in the hands of incapable leaders.</String>
		<String _locID="71322">That's probably all the food that you need to feed your pitiful army.</String>
		<String _locID="71323">Sure, pick up all of these scraps. It won't help you face my military might!</String>
		<String _locID="71324">You sure are greedy, but it won't help you!</String>
		<String _locID="71325">A whole new world to explore, and you choose to steal from me? Pathetic!</String>
		<String _locID="71326">Those natives will not be happy to have been taken under your wing once the nest is on fire.</String>
		<String _locID="71327">Your workforce has scattered through the wilderness, so now you must herd them back like sheep?</String>
		<String _locID="71328">I deserved that wood. My woodworking is much more skillful than yours.</String>
		<String _locID="71329">Walls? I'll blast right through them!</String>
		<String _locID="71330">The locals fight with me! Clearly, they recognize who is superior.</String>
		<String _locID="71331">The locals know who has the best goods for trading!</String>
		<String _locID="71332">Aha! Something of value!</String>
		<String _locID="71333">This gold will pave the way for Swedish supremacy in these new lands!</String>
		<String _locID="71334">I would kill for some fresh Swedish fish...</String>
		<String _locID="71335">These resources are best used in capable hands. Let me help you with this.</String>
		<String _locID="71336">Unlike yours, my explorer is efficient in finding new treasures.</String>
		<String _locID="71337">The natives will repay that favor by bringing me your head.</String>
		<String _locID="71338">I can see it in these settlers' eyes - they are relieved to be working for me rather than for you.</String>
		<String _locID="71339">More workers for the Swedish Empire!</String>
		<String _locID="71340">With this wood I shall build a Torp.</String>
		<String _locID="71341">You feel the need to drag natives into our war? So be it.</String>
		<String _locID="71342">The locals are trading with you only because they haven't met me yet.</String>
		<String _locID="71343">A true general fights on the battlefield, but whatever floats your boat.</String>
		<String _locID="71344">The winner takes it all!</String>
		<String _locID="71355">Here we either make Italy, or we die.</String>
		<String _locID="71356">Now we only need to cling to our empire of commerce like the Medicis!</String>
		<String _locID="71357">United we stand!</String>
		<String _locID="71358">Immediatamente!</String>
		<String _locID="71359">The beat of my cannonfire will teach a lesson they will never forget.</String>
		<String _locID="71360">The heavy plashing of our horses' hoofs will signal our brisk approach.</String>
		<String _locID="71361">My infantry will make a forced march to catch them off guard.</String>
		<String _locID="71362">I only have a sabre and a carbine, which I carry on the front of my saddle.</String>
		<String _locID="71363">I can offer neither pay, nor quarters, nor food; I offer only hunger, thirst, forced marches, battles and death.</String>
		<String _locID="71364">Recruitment for my next expedition has not completed.</String>
		<String _locID="71365">I will not endanger my people for such a wasteful endeavour.</String>
		<String _locID="71366">My men are still weary from our last adventure.</String>
		<String _locID="71367">Our traders have been robbed of their rightful posts!</String>
		<String _locID="71368">The United States, once admirable in their fight for liberty, have fallen from fates favor. Down with king Washington!</String>
		<String _locID="71369">Soon I can found the United Aztec Republic, free from tyranny!</String>
		<String _locID="71370">A shame to see the British in such shambles. Even the Forum Romanum looks more stable.</String>
		<String _locID="71371">My men are eager to gain their share of the Dutch banks when this expedition succeeds.</String>
		<String _locID="71372">I would not lose sleep over a French monarch losing his head.</String>
		<String _locID="71373">Are we fighting Prussia or Austria now? It does not matter. Let us finish off these Germans!</String>
		<String _locID="71374">Unless there are a hundred Forest Prowlers still in hiding, the coming battle will be as swift as it will be decisive!</String>
		<String _locID="71375">A pitiful end for the Maltese, I had the pleasure of fighting along them in my first battle.</String>
		<String _locID="71376">Portuguese exploration skills did not translate well into military victories today.</String>
		<String _locID="71377">Soon we can rebuild the Genoese trading posts in the Black Sea and trade in Russian ports tax free!</String>
		<String _locID="71378">These Spanish royalists do nothing but issue a few bombastic proclamations – and keep themselves out of harm's way.</String>
		<String _locID="71379">Once the Chinese emperor surrenders, the Forbidden City will be open to everyone!</String>
		<String _locID="71380">Japanese swords have quite an edge, but our bayonets also have a point.</String>
		<String _locID="71381">I hope to capture a boatload of Indian spices – I have some old friends who can turn it into a boatload of money!</String>
		<String _locID="71382">Posterity will call the United States the Great Emancipator, a more enviable title than any crown could be, and greater than any merely mundane treasure.</String>
		<String _locID="71383">I heard stories of the old Aztecs on my journeys, but I never expected to receive such a lively example of their power!</String>
		<String _locID="71384">Once enemy to despotism, friend of the oppressed, the British Empire has forsaken its destiny. Let us take it down!</String>
		<String _locID="71385">Even while at odds with the French, I have the utmost respect for our brother-republicans.</String>
		<String _locID="71386">The Germans seem to have put aside their internal quarrels and united their firepower. Luckily, I have done the same for my beloved Italy.</String>
		<String _locID="71387">I always thought the Sicilians are the scarier islanders. Today the Maltese knights have proven me wrong!</String>
		<String _locID="71388">If they could, the Portuguese would construct Town Centers on the stars. Per aspera ad astra!</String>
		<String _locID="71389">I once sold oranges to Russia in Taganrog; they may not have enjoyed their taste – for now they are coming after us!</String>
		<String _locID="71390">The Spanish Bourbons are a thorn in my side! I will need to succeed where Pisacane failed!</String>
		<String _locID="71391">Here's the plan: If the Swedes attack, we just kill their leader in the fray of battle and we win the war!</String>
		<String _locID="71392">The Chinese weaponry is ingenious. Leonardo da Vinci would be jealous.</String>
		<String _locID="71393">The fighting spirit of these Japanese Samurai is the one our troops need to win.</String>
		<String _locID="71394">I hear the stomping of Indian elephants at night, but I do not know if they are so close, or just haunting me from afar.</String>
		<String _locID="71395">Mamma mia! You race through the ages like a red Roman chariot!</String>
		<String _locID="71396">Your technological progress is faster than the Bersaglieri can run. Breathtaking!</String>
		<String _locID="71397">Without the benefits of Commerce, we can never hope to defeat our enemies.</String>
		<String _locID="71398">Do not be afraid to age up – new things await you!</String>
		<String _locID="71399">A splendid feat, now take the battle to our enemies as soon as you can!</String>
		<String _locID="71400">Ah! You've finally returned from your travels – or from exile? I know how time flies, I have been through the same.</String>
		<String _locID="71401">We are facing great adversity on the field of battle, I am close to admitting defeat.</String>
		<String _locID="71402">My republic has seen better days than these, I must resort to asking you for immediate help.</String>
		<String _locID="71403">Anyone who wants to carry on the war against the oppressors, follow me! Anyone who loves his country, follow me!</String>
		<String _locID="71404">To arms, all – all of you!</String>
		<String _locID="71405">There is no shame in choosing a lower difficulty, but do not expect remorse from me now.</String>
		<String _locID="71406">You have conquered and you will conquer still, because you are prepared for the tactics that decide the fate of battles.</String>
		<String _locID="71407">To this wonderful page in our country's history, another more glorious still will be added, with your valuable help.</String>
		<String _locID="71408">Did I leave such a memorable impression on you that I have been chosen as your ally this time?</String>
		<String _locID="71409">The hour of battle will find me with you again, by the side of the champions of Italian liberty.</String>
		<String _locID="71410">Odd. I have been to this country before! – Can we travel to another country next time?</String>
		<String _locID="71411">And so we meet again, marching together to the redemption of our brothers who are still slaves of the stranger.</String>
		<String _locID="71412">We shall meet again before long to march to new triumphs.</String>
		<String _locID="71413">Being extorted to save my explorer has only strengthened my resolve!</String>
		<String _locID="71414">Take this and hire some mercenaries for our next battle. If you don't know where to look, I know a guy.</String>
		<String _locID="71415">Our farmers were particularly industrious today, here are some tomatoes!</String>
		<String _locID="71416">You know the feeling: Someone cooked too much pasta. Have some!</String>
		<String _locID="71417">Put this fine cypress wood to good use!</String>
		<String _locID="71418">Cypress forests sprawl my land; I am glad to be rid of some of it.</String>
		<String _locID="71419">I have mustered my men, our spirits are high, their town will lay in ruins by tonight!</String>
		<String _locID="71420">The freedom of our people is near!</String>
		<String _locID="71421">I am not afraid to get right up to my enemies and build in their front garden.</String>
		<String _locID="71422">The more Italian city states, the better!</String>
		<String _locID="71423">As long as my people do not go hungry, I will provide you with Food.</String>
		<String _locID="71424">A lot of trees must fall for this; only time will tell if I can fell enough.</String>
		<String _locID="71425">If you ever should be so circumstanced as to require the help of an ally, cursed be the Italian who would not step forward with me in defence.</String>
		<String _locID="71426">This is not the carnival in Venice. We will not mask ourselves. We will go in all guns blazing!</String>
		<String _locID="71427">I saw the bottom of my war chest today, I need Coin urgently!</String>
		<String _locID="71428">My people are starving, I can't maintain my armies this way. Please send me some of your bread.</String>
		<String _locID="71429">I have promised a nice priest to repair the Basilica, but I am in need of some of your timber!</String>
		<String _locID="71430">My war chest is overflowing now! Let us bring down some monarchies!</String>
		<String _locID="71431">We will have a great feast tonight then!</String>
		<String _locID="71432">Thanks for the planks.</String>
		<String _locID="71433">The United States should be an example to us – their unity makes them unbreakable!</String>
		<String _locID="71434">The Aztecs are not discouraged by their losses. On the contrary, they seem encouraged to fight on!</String>
		<String _locID="71435">It is somewhat humiliating that my revolutionary Redshirts are losing to British Redcoats – but there are just too many.</String>
		<String _locID="71436">Whether the world economy booms or collapses, the banks always win. A Medici would be handy now. Too bad they are dead.</String>
		<String _locID="71437">We will make the French pay! For the Tapestries of Raffaele, shot through with French bullets! Let them pay for the losses—no, not the losses, but the insult cast on Michelangelo!</String>
		<String _locID="71438">The German needle guns are devastating; my army is in stitches.</String>
		<String _locID="71439">The forests are filled with tomahawks, handy while chopping trees, but my Villagers refuse to go now.</String>
		<String _locID="71440">The Maltese knights must be getting support from the Pope again. I should have marched on Rome when I had the chance!</String>
		<String _locID="71441">The grip and reach of the Ottoman Empire rivals that of the Roman Empire. Legions of Janissaries subdue these lands.</String>
		<String _locID="71442">I wish that I and my fellow Brazilian Revolutionaries were more successful against these Portuguese puppet rulers when we still had a chance!</String>
		<String _locID="71443">Is it always this cold here? Or why is the Russian empire thriving today? – Quick, someone hand me my poncho!</String>
		<String _locID="71444">I was wrong, South America's horses are not the best in the world.</String>
		<String _locID="71445">As if it could not get any harder the Spanish decided to create the Kingdom of Two Sicilies. One Sicily is enough!</String>
		<String _locID="71446">One more Carolean charge and I will have no one left to countercharge.</String>
		<String _locID="71447">The Chinese still have so much gunpowder left stored after beating us that they are starting to shoot it in the air for fun!</String>
		<String _locID="71448">The Japanese kids seem to have learnt a lot about our weaknesses when they visited Italy ages ago. Crazy!</String>
		<String _locID="71449">The Americans call us gangsters, but look at them! Cowboys, Owlhoots, and Gunslingers roam the countryside!</String>
		<String _locID="71450">I had a terrible day. I woke up and stepped on a War Hut. I ate breakfast and bit on an Eagle Scout.</String>
		<String _locID="71451">The British Longbowmen may have a tea break before they take a shot, but our Pavisiers were even slower to place their shields in time.</String>
		<String _locID="71452">Even the Papal Guards were unnerved by the sheer amount of Dutch halberdiers. Like roses made of steel.</String>
		<String _locID="71453">These French think themselves on the side of fine arts and culture, yet half of their heroes are Italians! I have had enough!</String>
		<String _locID="71454">The German mercenary swords are only feeble reeds now, but we have suffered one too many sword blows, too.</String>
		<String _locID="71455">The Maltese order of knights is almost down to their last man, but – who is that terrifying Scottish swordsman?</String>
		<String _locID="71456">We offered so little resistance that the Ottomans will capture the rest of Italy just as easily as the Venetian colonies!</String>
		<String _locID="71457">If we do not improve our situation, our people and those of Portugal might join together and overthrow us all, and then make their own republic, since none of us are fit to rule.</String>
		<String _locID="71458">The Russian Oprichniki made no difference whipping their own workers and ours. Unfortunately, their troops cost less than our expensive mercenaries.</String>
		<String _locID="71459">Where, I ask, are the Carabinieri when you need them most?! Not a single one!</String>
		<String _locID="71460">Spain seems to have an economic crisis, but dragged us into it as well. Only a fat Spanish treasure ship can save us now.</String>
		<String _locID="71461">The Swedes seem to be low on gunpowder, but at this point they can beat us even with their blades alone.</String>
		<String _locID="71462">I don't know for how much longer our Pavese shields can stop those Chinese Chu Ko Nu bolts!</String>
		<String _locID="71463">Japan is composing a lot of poetry lately; their favorite new topic seems to be our demise.</String>
		<String _locID="71464">Unfortunately, Marco Polo did not show us everything about India that we should have seen.</String>
		<String _locID="71465">I am in mighty company! Sadly, I can not keep up with you.</String>
		<String _locID="71466">When this war started, I had full confidence in our alliance. I am reconsidering my choice of allies now.</String>
		<String _locID="71467">It is a great day to be alive! We shall not let this victory slip through our fingers!</String>
		<String _locID="71468">I have never met a great tactician like you! It is an honor for every Italian to have fought alongside you in this war.</String>
		<String _locID="71469">I am a gentle soul and thus I will forgive you for not performing to my standards. Luckily I outdid myself this time, which will grant us this victory.</String>
		<String _locID="71470">A treacherous Minister of war squandered doubloons, supporting his splendid banquets in the first capitals of Europe.</String>
		<String _locID="71471">If there were still powder and shot, we would continue the fight—not for victory, not to save ourselves, but for honor!</String>
		<String _locID="71472">I have nothing around me but men lying down overcome with fatigue, and hear no sound except the lamentations of the unfortunate wounded, not yet transported to the hospital.</String>
		<String _locID="71473">We have allowed our sworn enemies to build up their trade. Now it is time for us to rectify that mistake.</String>
		<String _locID="71474">They have already befriended the local population. We cannot win a war in a land where the populace is against us – we must start making allies as well!</String>
		<String _locID="71475">Already living off the land are you? Great to see you adapt so quickly to these circumstances.</String>
		<String _locID="71476">We should leave nothing behind for the enemy, take all that you can!</String>
		<String _locID="71477">I wonder who left their purse behind.</String>
		<String _locID="71478">Ah! Cantucci! What a sweet surprise!</String>
		<String _locID="71479">I should pay close attention to your treasure-gathering technique, it is very efficient.</String>
		<String _locID="71480">I was saving that one for later!</String>
		<String _locID="71481">It is not a bad shout to get to know the locals better.</String>
		<String _locID="71482">He who finds a friend, finds a treasure.</String>
		<String _locID="71483">Extraordinary to find so many planks in the wild.</String>
		<String _locID="71484">Exquisite treasures in this region! I want to bring a few of them to my island home on Caprera.</String>
		<String _locID="71485">A treasure full of coin! My old pirating instincts do not leave me hanging!</String>
		<String _locID="71486">Ahh! Some cheese, some olive oil and tartufo. A firework for the senses!</String>
		<String _locID="71487">I hope you did not need that treasure. Eventually it is a team effort, right?</String>
		<String _locID="71488">Ahh! This is just like in my early days traveling through South America.</String>
		<String _locID="71489">We found a lost soldier who will teach us the way of fighting in these lands.</String>
		<String _locID="71490">A new member joins the liberation front of Italy!</String>
		<String _locID="71491">This wood will house my next military expedition.</String>
		<String _locID="71492">All great Italian cities have proper walls! Genoa, Milan, Pisa, Florence, Venice, Rome... – and even I am bit of an architect myself!</String>
		<String _locID="71493">Let us beat these greedy capitalists at their own game!</String>
		<String _locID="71494">If this is the end, I am pleased that we could at least settle our disputes in a civilized manner.</String>
		<String _locID="71495">Your loss is imminent! To save face, I can offer you a place in our Basilica. There is plenty of space, and you can also atone for your sins and other failures.</String>
		<String _locID="71496">You think your fighters can handle such advanced weaponry without blowing themselves to pieces? Better hand it over to me now before anyone gets hurt.</String>
		<String _locID="71497">Have you taken a break? Forgotten about your... 'Empire'?</String>
		<String _locID="71498">The old Romans were arrogant, but they would have been right to call you barbarian – considering how far you are behind.</String>
		<String _locID="71499">Keep repeating the same strategies and you will need to get patched up! Because after I perfectly countered your plan, you will need one for your bruises.</String>
		<String _locID="71500">Ready or not, here my rush comes. Or not.</String>
		<String _locID="71501">Welcome to the age of your destruction!</String>
		<String _locID="71502">All alone hiding in the wilderness? Watch out for the wolves. They are hungry!</String>
		<String _locID="71503">This town of yours is so close to my ally. Unless it wants to become a part of Italy, it is going to be in trouble!</String>
		<String _locID="71504">Another monopoly bites the dust!</String>
		<String _locID="71505">I am Giuseppe Garibaldi and my favorite enemies are oppressive, corrupt monarchs who tax too much. Did I describe you well?</String>
		<String _locID="71506">Your timid doctrinaires can carry their servility and miserable fears elsewhere. This people is its own master!</String>
		<String _locID="71507">We will no longer follow in the trail of men whose hearts are foul.</String>
		<String _locID="71508">There is no point in lying, Pinocchio. Your wooden nose came a little too close to the fire in the last game!</String>
		<String _locID="71509">I have a memory of this place – and I will use that knowledge to bring about your defeat.</String>
		<String _locID="71510">Our odds may look odd, but I won worse!</String>
		<String _locID="71511">You asked for a battle, we will give you a war.</String>
		<String _locID="71512">Your explorer does not seem so bad. But our explorer rediscovered the Americas! How do you top that, eh?</String>
		<String _locID="71513">Even the Pope commands more Papal Guards than you have men in your army.</String>
		<String _locID="71514">I know, I know! The Basilica looks truly magnificent. Surely that is why some of your men are paying me a visit?</String>
		<String _locID="71515">Our barricades are strong and numerous! The bastions crowned with cannons to fire upon the enemy! And the young army, impatient with warlike ardor, is placed at points where the attack is expected!</String>
		<String _locID="71516">This battle will not even be my magnus opus – let me direct this opera anyway.</String>
		<String _locID="71517">You barbarian! You destroy and ransack like the Huns just for the sake of it! I shall avenge this insult!</String>
		<String _locID="71518">Are these your emissaries? – or did I already buy off all the mercenaries that were available? Curious.</String>
		<String _locID="71519">Your people must be unhappy with your rule, working for a town in such disarray.</String>
		<String _locID="71520">We have a little problem. My men just cannot agree on how to defeat you. All options seem promising!</String>
		<String _locID="71521">My comrades have a plan to overthrow your despotic rule that steals your worker's incomes and builds an empire on violence!</String>
		<String _locID="71522">He who dies for his country has lived long enough. Let us end this?</String>
		<String _locID="71523">Today I am obliged to retire, but for a few days only. Do you accept?</String>
		<String _locID="71524">You have not just disappointed me with your unjustly aggression, you have disappointed the world.</String>
		<String _locID="71525">You gather treasures, I gather people looking for freedom.</String>
		<String _locID="71526">Take what you can, while you still can.</String>
		<String _locID="71527">Oh, I think I lost that treasure here a decade ago, thanks for picking it up, I will collect it soon.</String>
		<String _locID="71528">With some salt and olive oil, it is going to taste magnificient!</String>
		<String _locID="71529">Your indiscriminate looting of the countryside will turn the populace against you – to my advantage!</String>
		<String _locID="71530">Looting your treasuries seems more and more lucrative. Keep going!</String>
		<String _locID="71531">Feel right at home in my base, soon enough a prison here will house you forever.</String>
		<String _locID="71532">You really needed to drag the inhabitants into this? Royals – always need to make a scene...</String>
		<String _locID="71533">Another poor soul that needs to be freed from a tyrant. I will gladly be that Spartacus.</String>
		<String _locID="71534">That wood will not be sufficient to build a chair to fit your rich, royal... body.</String>
		<String _locID="71535">Walls, walls... no battle? What are you, a Roman tortoise? Come out and play!</String>
		<String _locID="71536">Natives of the country, and therefore perfectly acquainted with every place, choose the most thorny spots for their ambushes.</String>
		<String _locID="71537">First of many! Even the Medici had their humble beginnings.</String>
		<String _locID="71538">My natural instinct for exploration will always grant me the best treasure on the map.</String>
		<String _locID="71539">An old pirate friend left this one for me.</String>
		<String _locID="71540">This food will make the rations for my next expedition.</String>
		<String _locID="71541">That treasure was not yours. It was already there before you invaded this land.</String>
		<String _locID="71542">I know you cannot compete in treasures against an experienced explorer like me, but you could try a little harder.</String>
		<String _locID="71543">A local scout joined my army, he knows the perfect spot to ambush you!</String>
		<String _locID="71544">I will save the people lost in this land from your tyranny!</String>
		<String _locID="71545">Even strangers are eager to join my new nation.</String>
		<String _locID="71546">This wood will make my town more beautiful than yours, and more defensible.</String>
		<String _locID="71547">I will make acquaintances with the locals soon; they will not fight on the wrong side for long.</String>
		<String _locID="71548">You might be the first to trade, but I will be the one to make a profit.</String>
		<String _locID="71549">Our Italian merchants will teach you a lesson in building a real trade empire.</String>
		<String _locID="71550">The Pope forbade the usury of our Lombards, so we had no choice but to fall back on a more honest type of business.</String>
		<String _locID="71551">It looks like the Carolean charge is no match for the Italian countercharge!</String>

		<String _locID="781833">- Over 60 new maps have been added as "official maps" spanning across America, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Most of the maps were taken from the ESOC map pool and were improved visually, had layout issues fixed, and were updated with new content such as new fauna, flora, treasures, natives and textures.\n \n- The game with the mod on is now more compatible with Win10 and Win11, having the display settings fixed if the game's exe is not set to run in WinXP compatibility mode. The High/Low poly Cliffs option has also been fixed, usefull for custom maps with cliff framerate drops.\n \n- Ottomans are now a semi-Asian civilization, with a changed Mosque to better match the Monastery, with access to Export and a Consulate with new unique Asian allies (Indians, Chinese and Japanese), and new cards for the Consulate and mercs. Ottomans can now also pause and resume Settler training at will.\n \n- Ships can now sail over shallows on which ground units can also walk. Ships are no longer blocked by shallows such as those on Northwest Territory and Indochina, which also means you can now dock and make ships on Bayou.\n \n- Ships now fire consistently and accordingly to their assigned rate of fire, instead of firing random cannon shots which could have resulted in cases where in a fight between two identical ships, the one that fired first could lose because of random cannon fire.\n \n- When gathering from Mills and Plantations, villagers now stand still just like on Farms and Rice Paddies. They no longer move randomly around the building, bumping into each other and loosing precious gather time. Gather rates were adjusted accordingly.\n \n- Further AI improvements, specifically related to attacking enemy units, upgrading trade routes and training mercs and natives.\n \n- Map sizes have been tweaked, making most maps bigger, and the player can now spawn on both sides on all maps, old and new.\n \n- Added new Fire Pit dances and made some of them random; the first four Ages will unlock one fixed dance and one random dance. Also randomized shipments for Native and Asian Age Up options, just like Politicians and Consulate allies previously.\n \n- The AIs for the mod's civilizations now have unique voice lines! Go to "Documents\My Games\AoE3 Improvement Mod" and delete the "AIM" and "Users3" folders to make them work.</String>
